THE DAY SONG


  All now for to fetch home,
    The Summer and the May, O!
  For Summer is a-come, O!
    And Winter is a-go, O!

  Up flies the kite,
    And down falls the lark, O!
  Un Ursula Bird she had an old ewe, O!
    And she died in Old Park O!

  Oh, where is St. George?
    Oh where is he, O?
  He's down in his long boat,
    All on the salt sea, O!

  Oh, where are those French dogs?
    Oh, where are they, O?
  They're down in their long boats,
    All on the salt sea, O!

  Oh, where are those French dogs?
    Oh where are they, O!
  They shall eat the grey goose feathers,
    And we will eat the roast, O!


The last verse of the Morning Song is sung to its own tune to conclude
the Day Song.

Padstow itself is a queer old fishing town, fifteen miles from Bodmin,
from which place it is easily reached by train. It is situated at the
mouth of the Camel, the finest salmon river in Cornwall, and has at St.
Enodoc, on the other side of the estuary, one of the best golf courses
in England.
