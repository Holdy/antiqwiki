THE MAY MORNING SONG


  Unite! All unite! It's now all unite,
    For Summer is a-come in today;
  And whither we are going it's all now unite,
    In the merry morning of May!

  With the merry singing and the joyful spring,
    For summer is a-come in to-day,
  How happy are those little birds that merrily doth sing
    In the merry morning of May!

  _Chorus: Unite! all unite! &c, after each verse._

  Young men and maidens, I warn you every one,
    For summer is a-come in to-day,
  To go unto the green woods and bring the may home
    In the merry morning of May!

  Rise up, Mr ----, with your sword by your side,
    For summer is a-come in to-day,
  Your steed is in the stable and waiting for to ride
    In the merry morning of May!

  Rise up, Mr ----, and gold be your ring,
    For summer is a-come in to-day,
  And send us out a cup of ale, and better we shall sing,
    In the merry morning of May!

  Rise up, Mrs ----, all in your gown of green,
    For summer is a-come in to-day;
  You are so fair a lady as waits upon the queen,
    In the merry morning of May!

  Rise up, Mr ----, I know you well a fine,
    For summer is a-come in to-day;
  You have a shilling in your purse, but I wish it was in mine,
    In the merry morning of May!

  Rise up, Miss ----, and strew all your flowers,
    For summer is a-come in to-day;
  It is but a while ago since we have strewed ours,
    In the merry morning of May!

  Rise up, Miss ----, and reach to me your hand
    For summer is a-come in to-day;
  You are so fair a damsel as any in the land,
    In the merry morning of May!

  Rise up Master ----, and reach to me your hand,
    For summer is a-come in to day;
  And you shall have a lively lass, and a thousand pounds in hand,
    In the merry morning of May!

  Where are the maidens that here now should sing?
    For summer is a-come in to day,
  Oh, they are in the meadows the flowers gathering,
    In the merry morning of May!

  The young maids of Padstow, they might if they would--
    For summer is a-come in to day--
  They might have a garland, and decked it all in gold,
    In the merry morning of May!

  Where are the young men that here now should dance?
    For summer is a-come in to day;
  Oh some they are in England, and some they are in France,
    In the merry morning of May!

  The young men of Padstow, they might if they would--
    For summer is a-come in to-day--
  They might have built a ship, and gilt her all in gold,
    In the merry morning of May!

  Now fare ye well, we bid you all good cheer,
    For summer is a-come in to-day,
  We'll call once more unto your house before another year,
    In the merry morning of May!
