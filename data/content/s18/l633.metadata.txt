summary: The legendary lost land of Lyonesse, reputedly a fertile region extending from Cornwall to the Scillies, was submerged by the sea during a devastating storm in 1099, leaving behind only the Scilly Islands and the rocky remains known as the Seven Stones. According to tradition, this land gradually succumbed to the sea, with its final inundation being documented in tales of survivors like Trevilian, who narrowly escaped on horseback, and is remembered through stories of submerged villages and relics sometimes caught in fishermen’s nets.
