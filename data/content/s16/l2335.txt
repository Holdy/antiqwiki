"On another occasion a lady and her child were staying for a few days at
the castle. The child was asleep in an adjoining dressing-room, and the
lady, having gone to bed, lay awake for a while. Suddenly a cold blast
stole into the room, extinguishing the night-light by her bedside, but not
affecting the one in the dressing-room beyond, in which her child had its
cot. By that light she saw a tall mailed figure pass into the
dressing-room from that in which she was lying. Immediately thereafter
there was a shriek from the child. Her maternal instinct was aroused. She
rushed into the dressing-room, and found the child in an agony of fear.
It described what it had seen as a giant, who came and leant over its
face.
