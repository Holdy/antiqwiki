MODERN SPIRITUALISM.


"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly that, in the latter times, some shall
depart from the Faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of
devils."--_1 Tim. iv. 1._

"Many believe that the final assault upon Christianity will be made by the
enemies of God, bonded and compacted together into an universal kingdom.
It may be, as some have held, that another Incarnation shall take place;
and that the Enemy of souls will be permitted to assume man's nature.
Anyhow, we are told that Antichrist shall _reign_. Thousands, deluded by
false miracles and lying wonders, will become his subjects, his willing
votaries; and own him as their king. His worship will be an adroit
counterfeit of the worship of the True God--his kingdom a parody of the
Catholic Church; while its doctrines will be at once so attractive and
delusive to fallen man as that the predicted Apostasy will be great and
widespread."--_Sermons on Antichrist._
