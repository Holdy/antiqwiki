Another example, unusually curious, relating to the Castle at York, is
taken from the "Memoirs of Sir John Reresby:"--

"One of my soldiers being on guard about eleven in the night at the gate
of Clifford Tower, the very night after the witch was arraigned, he heard
a great noise at the Castle; and, going to the porch, he saw there a
scroll of paper creep from under the door, which, as he imagined by
moonshine, turned first into the shape of a monkey, and thence assumed the
form of a turkey-cock, which passed to and fro by him. Surprised at this,
he went to the prison, and called the under-keeper, who came and saw the
scroll dance up and down, and creep under the door, where there was scarce
an opening of the thickness of half-a-crown. This extraordinary story I
had from the mouth both of one and the other."[32]
