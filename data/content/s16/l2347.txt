"An accomplished antiquarian, who has investigated this subject, writes as
follows:--There is a tradition that in olden times, during one of the
frequent feuds between the Lindsays and the Ogilvies, a large number of
the latter, in flying from their enemies, came to Glamis, and claimed
hospitality. The master of the castle did not like to deny them the
protection of his castle walls. He therefore admitted them; and on plea of
hiding them, is reported to have put them into this out-of-the-way
chamber. There he let them starve, and it is said that their bones lie
there unto this day, the bodies never having been buried. This may have
been the sight which startled the late Lord Strathmore on entering the
haunted room--a large number of skeletons lying in the various parts of
the place was a sight calculated to startle any man. And these are
declared to be peculiarly revolting. Some had apparently died in the act
of gnawing the flesh off their own arms."
