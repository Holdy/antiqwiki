summary: Spiritualism asserts that death is merely the transition of the soul from the body, and what observers perceive as a lifeless body is actually undergoing transformation according to a perpetual law of life. This philosophy denies the Christian concept of bodily resurrection, suggesting instead that even the so-called dead matter continues to contribute to the cycle of life and spiritual evolution.
