summary: An English clergyman and his family experienced haunting phenomena after moving into an old-fashioned house near a northern Scottish city, hearing unusual noises and feeling invisible presences. It was believed that the house was haunted due to a historical murder involving a nobleman's mistress, driving some residents, including a servant who lost her reason, to madness.
