summary: At a gathering in one of the midland counties in 1856, a series of questions were posed to a spirit through table-turning, revealing it had been deceased for only five days and had lived nearby. The spirit predicted that in 25 years there would be the end of wickedness and a Millennium rather than the Last Judgment, and that Russia would conquer England during the reign of Queen Victoria's successor.
