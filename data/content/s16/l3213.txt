From another source (a well-known country gentleman in one of the midland
counties) has been obtained a series of questions and answers which were
put, given, and taken down in the year 1856, at a gathering at which the
practice of table-turning and spirit invocation was tested by those whose
conviction, in the main, regarding them, as the Editor is informed, agrees
with that of the correspondents already quoted. Similar strange phenomena
occurred on this occasion likewise:--
