Creslow in Buckinghamshire,[31] like so many old manor-houses, has its
ghost story. It is said to be the disturbed and restless spirit of a lady,
which haunts a certain sleeping chamber in the oldest portion of the
house. She has been seldom seen but often heard only too plainly by those
who have ventured to sleep in this room, or to enter it after midnight.
She appears to come up from the old groined crypt, and always enters by
the door at the top of the nearest staircase. After entering she is heard
to walk about, sometimes in a gentle, stately manner, apparently with a
long silk train sweeping the floor. Sometimes her motion is quick and
hurried, her silk dress rustling violently as if she were engaged in a
desperate struggle.
