The following example of an Apparition in Scotland, unlike those already
recorded, carries with it evidences of truth:--

"A gentleman of rank and property in Scotland served in his youth in the
army of the Duke of York in Flanders. He occupied the same tent with two
other officers, one of whom was sent on some service. One night during his
absence, this gentleman while in bed saw the figure of his absent friend
sitting on the vacant bed. He called to his companion, who also saw the
figure, which spoke to them, and said he had just been killed at a certain
place, pointing to his wound. He then requested them on returning to
England, to call at a certain agent's house in a certain street, and to
procure from him a document of great importance for the family of the
deceased. If the agent, as was probable, should deny the possession of
it, it would be found in a certain drawer of a cabinet in his room. Next
day it appeared that the officer had been shot as he had told them, in the
manner and at the time and place indicated. After the return of the troops
to England, the two friends walking together one day, found themselves in
the street where the agent lived, and the request of their friend recurred
to both, they having hitherto forgotten it. They called on the agent, who
denied having the paper in question; when they compelled him in their
presence to open the drawer of the cabinet, where it was found and
restored to the widow."[5]
