summary: Lord Brougham recounts a peculiar incident from his life where he saw an apparition of his old friend G---- while taking a bath, despite having had no prior contact or memory of him for years. After later learning of G----'s death on the same day as the vision, Brougham concluded it was a confirmation of their pact about life after death, though he initially believed it was just a vivid dream.
