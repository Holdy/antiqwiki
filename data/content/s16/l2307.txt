The following comes to the Editor from Scotland:--

"There is, without a doubt, a 'Haunted Room' in Glamis Castle. Access to
it now is cut off by a stone wall, and none are supposed to know where it
is, except Lord Strathmore, his eldest son, and the Factor on the estate.
This wall was built some years ago by the present proprietor. Strange,
weird, and unearthly noises have been heard from time to time by numbers,
and these by many persons wholly unprepared for the same. The following
statement is from the lips of a lady who was sleeping in the castle one
night, and who knew nothing of the reputation of the house:--She was
undressing to retire for the night, when all of a sudden she was alarmed
by a most violent noise, which made her fancy that one of the walls of the
house had fallen. She rushed out into the passage, but no one but herself
had been aroused by it. So she went back, and slept until morning. She
mentioned the circumstance at breakfast, but the subject was evidently an
unpleasant one. The conversation was at once changed, and she received a
hint to take no further notice of it. Some members of the family cannot
bear the subject to be alluded to, and repel all inquiries."
