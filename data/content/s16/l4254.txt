CHAPTER X.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION.


Before a brief summary is made of the contents and purport of this book,
an account of a most remarkable event which occurred at Oxford about
forty-five years ago may be fitly chronicled. It will be known, in its
general outline, by many Oxford men; and was given to the Editor in the
month of June, 1854, by a member of Brasenose College, where it had
occurred.
