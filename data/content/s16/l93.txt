SPECTRAL APPEARANCES.


"Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little
thereof.

In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,

Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.

Then a Spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:

It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an Image was
before mine eyes."--_Job iv. 12-16._
