summary: A soldier on guard at Clifford Tower in York witnessed a mysterious scroll of paper transform into a monkey and then into a turkey-cock the night after a witch's arraignment. He reported the incident to the prison's under-keeper, who also saw the scroll move and dance under a door with a very narrow opening.
