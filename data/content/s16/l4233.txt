SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION.


"The Angel of the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear Him, and
delivereth them."--_Psalm xxxiv. 7._

"God sees at one view the whole thread of my existence, not only that part
of it which I have already passed through, but that which runs forward
into all the depths of Eternity. When I lay me down to sleep I recommend
myself to His care; when I awake I give myself up to His direction. Amidst
all the evils that threaten me, I look up to Him for help, and question
not that He will either avert them, or turn them to my advantage. Though I
know neither the time nor the manner of the death I am to die, I am not at
all solicitous about it: because I am sure that He knows them both, and
that He will not fail to comfort and support me under them."--_Addison._

"Reverence the angels; shun the demons."--_Thomas Scott._
