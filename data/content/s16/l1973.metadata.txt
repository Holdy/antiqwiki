summary: A miller named Porteous, who was imprisoned in Spedlin's Tower by Sir Alexander Jardine and accidentally left to die, became a ghost that haunted the tower. Porteous's spirit was eventually confined by exorcists to the tower using a large black-lettered Bible, which, when once removed, caused the ghost to cross the river and disturb the Jardine family until the book was returned.
