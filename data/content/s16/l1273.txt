The following is another statement of facts vouched for by those who
formally testify to its truth:--

    "One evening in the autumn of the year 1868, my wife retired to bed
    early. On my entering the bedroom about midnight, I found her wide
    awake, and in a very excited state. On inquiring the cause, she stated
    that she believed most firmly she had seen our old friend Mrs. G----,
    then residing at a distance, whom we believed to be in perfect health.
    My wife gave a minute description of her dress, which I had remembered
    to have seen her wear, and at the same time stated that when the
    apparition appeared to her, every object in the bedroom was strangely
    but distinctly visible. Of course I tried to allay my wife's
    excitement by assuring her that she was suffering from the effects of
    an unpleasant dream, but I failed to shake her conviction that she had
    seen the spirit of our friend.

    "Nothing occurred during the next day, but on the following we
    received a letter from a relative, stating that Mrs. G---- had died
    the night before about twelve o'clock.

    "It appears that Mrs. G----, while in her garden, was observed to fall
    upon one of the flower beds. Having been taken to her room, medical
    aid was promptly procured, but without avail: she remained unconscious
    from that time until the moment of her death, which occurred about
    twelve o'clock the same evening.
