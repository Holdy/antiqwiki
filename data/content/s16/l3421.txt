MODERN SPIRITUALISM.

CONTINUED.


"Superstition, in its grossest form, is the worship of Evil
Spirits."--_John Henry Newman._

"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except
there come a falling away first, and that Man of Sin be revealed, the Son
of Perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called
God, or that is worshipped.... Whose coming is after the working of Satan,
with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of
unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of
the Truth that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them
a strong delusion that they should believe a lie."--_2 Thess. ii. 3-11._

"The greatest intellectual triumph that can be achieved by the Devil is
gained when men are prepared to believe that he is not."--_Sermons_, _Rev.
T. T. Lee_ (A.D. 1796).
