summary: E. Lenthal Swifte recounts a haunting experience in the Jewel House of the Tower of London in 1817, where he and his family witnessed a mysterious cylindrical apparition during supper, causing significant terror, especially to his wife who believed it had seized her. The apparitional encounter culminated in further eerie incidents, including a guard being terrified by a bear-like figure, who later diedâ€”a sequence of events for which Swifte pledges his credibility and honour.
