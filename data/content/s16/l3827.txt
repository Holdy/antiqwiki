Now, though Spiritualism be ignored by the press, Universalism, its own
offspring, is constantly and persistently maintained. Spiritualism also
flatly denies the great Christian doctrine of the Resurrection of the
body:--

"Spiritualism teaches, on the authority of Scripture and of all
spirit-life, that there is no such thing as death: it is but a name given
to the issue of the soul from the body. To those in bodies who witness
this change, the spirit is invisible, and they only see a body which
ceases all its living functions, has lost that intelligence which during
so-called 'life' emanated from it, and lies stiff and cold, and to all
appearance dead. But even the body is not dead. There is a law of life
even in what is called dead matter, which is perpetually changing its
particles and converting them into mere black earth and water, and hence
into all the articles necessary for the physical life--corn, meat, wine,
all foods, all fruits. The same law immediately begins to operate in the
dead body, and, if unobstructed, speedily resolves it back into earth, and
then forms this again into food and clothing and fresh enveloping forms
for fresh human beings. The whole of the universe is in perpetual action,
and the ever-revolving wheel of physical is subserving the perpetual
evolution of spiritual life."[55]
