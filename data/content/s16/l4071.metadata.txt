summary: Mr. Wallace presents a defense of Modern Spiritualism by arguing for the scientific reality of its phenomena, challenging traditional religious notions and suggesting that this new understanding could lead to a purer morality based on natural consequences rather than dogmatic beliefs. He posits that humans consist of a duality with spirits that evolve and communicate through mediums, which could reshape our understanding of morality and the afterlife, while acknowledging that the science is still developing.
