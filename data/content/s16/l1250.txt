The following statement is vouched for by the person signing the same:--

    "In the summer of 1816, my father and mother having retired to bed
    about nine o'clock, the latter was about to draw down the blind, when
    she observed the figure of a female approaching their house by a
    footpath which communicated with the village. Thinking the
    circumstance unusual, she waited till the figure approached
    sufficiently near to discern its features, when she exclaimed to my
    father, 'Why, here is my sister B----; what can have induced her to
    come here at this time of the evening?' She was about to prepare to go
    downstairs to inquire the cause of such a visit at that late time of
    night, when my mother observed the figure retracing its steps in the
    same direction by which it had come. The following morning, early,
    intelligence was brought to my mother that her sister B---- died at
    the same hour at which her apparition appeared to my mother. This is a
    simple statement of facts.

    "Signed by the son of the person to whom the apparition appeared.
