(II.) The celebrated Nicholas Ferrar, of Little Gidding, (who, in the
seventeenth century, lived a most retired, religious, and pious life,) had
a brother, a physician in London. This physician made a compact with his
eldest and favourite daughter that whichever of them died first should, if
happy, appear to the other. This compact is said to have proved the
subject of many conversations and religious discussions between father and
child. The latter is reported to have been very averse to making any such
agreement; but being overcome by arguments as to the reasonableness of
such a course (if permitted by a gracious and merciful God) at last
consented. After this she married and settled with her husband at
Gillingham Lodge, in the county of Wiltshire. Here she was prematurely
confined; and during her illness, one night by mistake took poison, and
died quite suddenly. That very night her spirit appeared to her father in
London, the curtains of whose bed she drew back, and with a sweet but
mournful expression looked upon him, and then gradually faded away. In
fact, and as a test of the objective reality of his daughter's apparition,
Dr. Ferrar, deeply impressed by the occurrence, announced the death of his
daughter to his family two days before he received intelligence of it by
the then tardy post.
