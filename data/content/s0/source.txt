~Changelings

Changelings are a common figure in European folklore, often described as 
fairy or supernatural beings left in place of human children who have been stolen by 
fairies, trolls, or other mystical creatures. These swapped children were believed to 
be sickly, strange in behavior, or developmentally different, often displaying unusual 
intelligence or physical deformities. In many tales, parents would attempt to force the 
changeling to reveal itself through cruel tests, such as exposing it to fire or iron, 
which were thought to repel fairies.

Possible Origins of the Changeling

Medical Explanations: Some scholars believe changeling legends arose to explain conditions like autism, dwarfism, or other developmental disorders, which were not understood in the past.

Psychological and Social Factors: Parents struggling with the grief of losing a healthy child to illness or deformity may have found solace in the belief that their child had been stolen rather than simply fallen sick.

Cultural Beliefs in Fairies and Spirits: Many European traditions saw fairies and supernatural creatures as envious of human beauty and vitality, leading to fears of child abduction.

Protection Mechanism: Some stories suggest that attributing a child's condition to a changeling could have acted as a coping mechanism, reducing stigma in a time when disabilities were often misunderstood or feared.

Economic Hardship: In times of extreme poverty, unwanted or disabled children may have been abandoned, and the changeling story could have provided a form of justification for these actions.


~Fairy Money

Two types:

Type one - looks like money of the day, but when kept turns into mushrooms or pebbles.

Type two - is perhaps of value, but becomes hot such that it burns the hands until dropped - 
at which point it will sink back into the earth.
