XXIII. ANDREW COFFEY.

_Source._--From the late D. W. Logie, written down by Mr. Alfred Nutt.

_Parallels._--Dr. Hyde's "Teig O'Kane and the Corpse," and Kennedy's
"Cauth Morrisy," _Legend Fict._, 158, are practically the same.

_Remarks._--No collection of Celtic Folk-Tales would be representative
that did not contain some specimen of the gruesome. The most effective
ghoul story in existence is Lover's "Brown Man."
