XIX. FAIR, BROWN, AND TREMBLING.

_Source._--Curtin, _Myths, &c., of Ireland_, 78 _seq._

_Parallels._--The latter half resembles the second part of the
Sea-Maiden (No. xvii.), which see. The earlier portion is a Cinderella
tale (on which see the late Mr. Ralston's article in _Nineteenth
Century_, Nov., 1879, and Mr. Lang's treatment in his Perrault). Miss
Roalfe Cox is about to publish for the Folk-Lore Society a whole
volume of variants of the Cinderella group of stories, which are
remarkably well represented in these isles, nearly a dozen different
versions being known in England, Ireland, and Scotland.
