XIV. JACK AND HIS COMRADES.

_Source._--Kennedy's _Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts_.

_Parallels._--This is the fullest and most dramatic version I know of
the Grimms' "Town Musicians of Bremen" (No. 27). I have given an
English (American) version in my _English Fairy Tales_, No. 5, in the
notes to which would be found references to other versions known in
the British Isles (_e. g._, Campbell, No. 11) and abroad. _Cf._
remarks on No. vi.
