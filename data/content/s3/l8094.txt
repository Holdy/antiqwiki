XVIII. LEGEND OF KNOCKMANY.

_Source._--W. Carleton, _Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry_.

_Parallels._--Kennedy's "Fion MacCuil and the Scotch Giant," _Legend
Fict._, 203-5.

_Remarks._--Though the venerable name of Finn and Cucullin (Cuchulain)
are attached to the heroes of this story, this is probably only to
give an extrinsic interest to it. The two heroes could not have come
together in any early form of their sagas since Cuchulain's reputed
date is of the first, Finn's of the third century A. D. (_c. f._
however, MacDougall's _Tales_, notes, 272). Besides, the grotesque
form of the legend is enough to remove it from the region of the
hero-tale. On the other hand, there is a distinct reference to Finn's
wisdom-tooth, which presaged the future to him (on this see _Revue
Celtique_, v. 201, Joyce, _Old Celt. Rom._, 434-5, and MacDougall, _l.
c._ 274). Cucullin's power-finger is another instance of the
life-index or external soul, on which see remarks on Sea-Maiden. Mr.
Nutt informs me that parodies of the Irish sagas occur as early as the
sixteenth century, and the present tale may be regarded as a specimen.
