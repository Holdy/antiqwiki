III. FIELD OF BOLIAUNS.

_Source._--T. Crofton Croker's _Fairy Legends of the South of
Ireland_, ed. Wright, pp. 135-9. In the original the gnome is a
Cluricaune, but as a friend of Mr. Batten's has recently heard the
tale told of a Lepracaun, I have adopted the better known title.

_Remarks._--_Lepracaun_ is from the Irish _leith bhrogan_, the one
shoemaker (_cf._ brogue), according to Dr. Hyde. He is generally seen
(and to this day, too) working at a single shoe, _cf._ Croker's story,
"Little Shoe," _l. c._ pp. 142-4. According to a writer in the _Revue
Celtique_, i., 256, the true etymology is _luchor pan_, "little man."
Dr. Joyce also gives the same etymology in _Irish Names and Places_,
i., 183, where he mentions several places named after them.
