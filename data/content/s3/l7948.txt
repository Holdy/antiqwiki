XV. SHEE AN GANNON AND GRUAGACH GAIRE.

_Source._--Curtin, _Myths and Folk-Lore of Ireland_, p. 114 _seq._ I
have shortened the earlier part of the tale, and introduced into the
latter a few touches from Campbell's story of "Fionn's Enchantment,"
in _Revue Celtique_, t. i., 193 _seq._

_Parallels._--The early part is similar to the beginning of "The
Sea-Maiden" (No. xvii., which see). The latter part is practically the
same as the story of "Fionn's Enchantment," just referred to. It also
occurs in MacInnes's _Tales_, No. iii., "The King of Albainn" (see Mr.
Nutt's notes, 454). The head-crowned spikes are Celtic, _cf._ Mr.
Nutt's notes (MacInnes's _Tales_, 453).

_Remarks._--Here again we meet the question whether the folk-tale
precedes the hero-tale about Finn or was derived from it, and again
the probability seems that our story has the priority as a folk-tale,
and was afterwards applied to the national hero, Finn. This is
confirmed by the fact that a thirteenth century French romance, _Conte
du Graal_, has much the same incidents, and was probably derived from
a similar folk-tale of the Celts. Indeed, Mr. Nutt is inclined to
think that the original form of our story (which contains a mysterious
healing vessel) is the germ out of which the legend of the Holy Grail
was evolved (see his _Studies in the Holy Grail_, p. 202 _seq._).
