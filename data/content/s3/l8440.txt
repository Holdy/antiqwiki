XXV. BREWERY OF EGGSHELLS.

_Source._--From the _Cambrian Quarterly Magazine, 1830_, vol. ii., p.
86; it is stated to be literally translated from the Welsh.

_Parallels._--Another variant from Glamorganshire is given in _Y
Cymmrodor_, vi., 209. Croker has the story under the title I have
given the Welsh one in his _Fairy Legends_, 41. Mr. Hartland, in his
_Science of Fairy Tales_, 113-6, gives the European parallels.
