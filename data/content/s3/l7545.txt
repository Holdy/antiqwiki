IV. HORNED WOMEN.

_Source._--Lady Wilde's _Ancient Legends_, the first story.

_Parallels._--A similar version was given by Mr. D. Fitzgerald in the
_Revue Celtique_, iv., 181, but without the significant and impressive
horns. He refers to _Cornhill_ for February, 1877, and to Campbell's
"Sauntraigh," No. xxii., _Pop. Tales_, ii., 52-4, in which a "woman of
peace" (a fairy) borrows a woman's kettle and returns it with flesh in
it, but at last the woman refuses, and is persecuted by the fairy. I
fail to see much analogy. A much closer one is in Campbell, ii., p.
63, where fairies are got rid of by shouting, "Dunveilg is on fire."
The familiar "lady-bird, lady-bird, fly away home, your house is on
fire and your children at home," will occur to English minds. Another
version in Kennedy's _Legendary Fictions_, p. 164, "Black Stairs on
Fire."

_Remarks._--Slievenamon is a famous fairy palace in Tipperary
according to Dr. Joyce, _l. c._ i., 178. It was the hill on which Finn
stood when he gave himself as the prize to the Irish maiden who should
run up it quickest. Grainne won him with dire consequences, as all the
world knows or ought to know (Kennedy, _Legend Fict._, 222, "How Fion
selected a Wife").
