II. GULEESH.

_Source._--From Dr. Douglas Hyde's _Beside the Fire_, 104-28, where it
is a translation from the same author's _Leabhar Sgeulaighteachta_.
Dr. Hyde got it from one Shamus O'Hart, a game-keeper of French-park.
One is curious to know how far the very beautiful landscapes in the
story are due to Dr. Hyde, who confesses to have only taken notes. I
have omitted a journey to Rome, paralleled, as Mr. Nutt has pointed
out, by the similar one of Michael Scott (_Waifs and Strays_, i., 46),
and not bearing on the main lines of the story. I have also dropped a
part of Guleesh's name; in the original he is "Guleesh na guss dhu,"
Guleesh of the black feet, because he never washed them; nothing turns
on this in the present form of the story, but one cannot but suspect
it was of importance in the original form.

_Parallels._--Dr. Hyde refers to two short stories, "Midnight Ride"
(to Rome) and "Stolen Bride," in Lady Wilde's _Ancient Legends_. But
the closest parallel is given by Miss Maclintock's Donegal tale of
"Jamie Freel and the Young Lady," reprinted in Mr. Yeats' _Irish Folk
and Fairy Tales_, 52-9. In the _Hibernian Tales_, "Mann o' Malaghan
and the Fairies," as reported by Thackeray in the _Irish Sketch-Book_,
c., xvi., begins like "Guleesh."
