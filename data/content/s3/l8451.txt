XXVI. LAD WITH THE GOAT-SKIN.

_Source._--Kennedy, _Legendary Fictions_, pp. 23-31. The Adventures of
"Gilla na Chreck an Gour'."

_Parallels._--"The Lad With the Skin Coverings" is a popular Celtic
figure, _cf._ MacDougall's Third Tale, MacInnes's Second, and a
reference in Campbell, iii., 147. According to Mr. Nutt (_Holy Grail_,
134), he is the original of Parzival. But the adventures in these
tales are not the "cure by laughing" incident which forms the centre
of our tale, and is Indo-European in extent (_cf._ references in
_English Fairy Tales_, notes to No. xxvii.). "The smith who made hell
too hot for him is Sisyphus," says Mr. Lang (Introd. to Grimm, p.
xiii); in Ireland he is Billy Dawson (Carleton, _Three Wishes_). In
the Finn-Saga, Conan harries hell, as readers of _Waverley_ may
remember "'Claw for claw, and devil take the shortest nails,' as Conan
said to the Devil" (_cf._ Campbell, _The Fians_, 73, and notes, 283).
Red-haired men in Ireland and elsewhere are always rogues (see Mr.
Nutt's references, MacInnes's _Tales_, 477; to which add the case in
"Lough Neagh," Yeats, _Irish Folk Tales_, p. 210).
