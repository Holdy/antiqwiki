summary: The story is a parody involving the legendary heroes Finn and Cuchulain, whose timelines do not historically align, yet they are brought together in a humorous narrative. The tale incorporates fantastical elements such as Finn's wisdom-tooth and Cucullin's power-finger, akin to a life-index, reflecting the grotesque instead of heroic qualities.
