summary: St. David, born to a pious Welsh princess named Non and a barbarous chief, established a sanctuary known as 'The Monk's Dyke' on lands given by his remorseful grandfather, leading a peaceful life of conversion and miracles. Following his death, a cathedral was built in his honor in the city of St. Davids, a unique and picturesque location on the Welsh coast that visitors can still explore today.
