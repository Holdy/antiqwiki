THE FURRY-DANCE TUNE

[Illustration: THE FURRY-DANCE TUNE (Sheet Music)]

The simple air only of "The Furry Dance" is given here. It was probably
originally played by a musician on the pipe, accompanying himself on the
tabor.

Remote Cornwall is still full of queer old customs and survivals of
other days. Helston, the "Metropolis" of that picturesque wild district
near the Lizard, forms a perfect setting for this interesting relic of
the past, and an ideal centre for those who wish to enjoy the beauties
and mystery of one of the most remote corners of our island.
