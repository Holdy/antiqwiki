  Robin Hood and little John,
      They both are gone to fair, O!
  And we will go to the merry green wood
      To see what they do there, O!
  And for to chase, O!
  To chase the buck and doe.

  With Halantow,
  Rumble Ow!
  For we were up as soon as any day, O!
  And for to fetch the Summer home,
  The Summer and the May, O!
  For Summer is a-come, O!
  And Winter is a-gone, O!

  Where are those Spaniards,
      That make so great a boast, O?
  They shall eat the grey goose feather,
      And we will eat the roast, O,
  In every land, O,
  The land where'er we go.
      With _Halantow, &c._

  As for Saint George, O,
      Saint George he was a Knight, O!
  Of all the Knights in Christendom,
      Saint Georgy is the right, O!
  In every land, O,
  The land where'er we go.
      With _Halantow, &c_.

  God bless Aunt Mary Moses,
      And all her powers and might, O,
  And send us peace in merry England,
      Both day and night, O,
  And send us peace in merry England,
  Both now and evermore, O!
      With _Halantow, &c_.
