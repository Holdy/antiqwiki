FOOTNOTES


{1}  It is also stated, that there is in the Hengwrt Library, a MS.
containing the Graal in Welsh, as early as the time of Henry I.  I had
hoped to have added this to the present collection; but the death of Col.
Vaughan, to whom I applied, and other subsequent circumstances, have
prevented me from obtaining access to it.

{2}  Hades.

{3}  The word “Pryder” or “Pryderi” means anxiety.

{4}  The version in the Greal adds, “And their coin was fairy money;”
literally, dwarf’s money: that is, money which, when received, appeared
to be good coin, but which, if kept, turned into pieces of fungus, &c.

{5}  This dialogue consists of a series of repartees with a play upon
words, which it is impossible to follow in the translation.

{6}  Taliesin.

{7}  The mention of Gwyddno Garanhir instead of Elphin ab Gwyddno in this
place is evidently an error of some transcriber of the MS.
