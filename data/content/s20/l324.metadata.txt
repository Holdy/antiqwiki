summary: Prince Bladud, afflicted with leprosy, discovered the hot springs near Bath when his pigs rolled in the hot mud and were cured of their skin diseases. Cured himself, Bladud built a city at the site of his healing, which became known as Bath, a city famed for its healing waters even before the Romans popularized it as Aquæ Sulis.
