SUMMER IS ICUMEN IN.

    Joyously and with a good swing.

    Sum-mer is i-cum-en in
    Loud-ly sing cuc-koo.
    Grow-eth seed and blow-eth mead,
    And springs the wood-land new.
    Sing cuc-koo.
    Ewe now bleat-eth af-ter lamb,
    Low-eth af-ter calf the cow.
    Bull-ock stert-eth. Buck now vert-eth,
    Mer-ri-ly sing, Cuc-koo! Cuc-koo! Cuc-koo!
    Thou sing’st well Cuc-koo,
    Nor cease thou ne-ver now!
