CASTLE MAHON.


    THEE, Lady, would I lead through Fairy-land
      (Whence cold and doubting reasoners are exiled,)
      A land of dreams, with air-built castles piled;
    The moonlight SHEFROS there, in merry band
    With artful CLURICAUNE, should ready stand
      To welcome thee—Imagination’s child!
      Till on thy ear would burst so sadly wild
    The BANSHEE’S shriek, who points with wither’d hand.
    In the dim twilight should the PHOOKA come,
      Whose dusky form fades in the sunny light,
      That opens clear calm LAKES upon thy sight,
    Where blessed spirits dwell in endless bloom.
    I know thee, Lady—thou wilt not deride
    Such Fairy Scenes.—Then onward with thy Guide.

                                  T. Crofton Croker. [signature]
