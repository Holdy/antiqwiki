LEGENDS OF THE PHOOKA.

    “Ne let house-fires, nor lightnings’ helpless harms,
    Ne let the _Pouke_, nor other evil spright,
    Ne let mischievous witches with their charms,
    Ne let hobgoblins, names whose sense we see not,
        Fray us with things that be not.”
                                                SPENSER.
