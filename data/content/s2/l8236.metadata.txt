summary: The story describes Carrigogunnel castle's grim history and the tale of the hag Grana, whose enchanted candle brought death to those who glanced at its light. Regan, a hero from the Finnii of Erin, extinguished the candle by hurling it into the river Shannon, ending Grana's terror; the stone thrown by the hag remains as a testament to this legend.
