     The Irish Phooka, in its nature, perfectly resembles the
     _Mahr_; and we have only to observe, that there is a particular
     German tradition of a spirit, which sits among reeds and alder
     bushes; and which, like the Phooka, leaps upon the back of
     those who pass by in the night, and does not leave them till
     they faint and fall to the earth.
