summary: O'Keefe, the lord of Fermoy, tried to avert the prophecy that his son would drown by building a castle atop Cairn Thierna, but his son's curiosity at a small vessel of water led to the fulfillment of the prophecy. Despite precautions to avoid water, the child saw his reflection in a water vessel, leaned in with wonder, and drowned, leaving the mountain top as a testament to fate's inescapability.
