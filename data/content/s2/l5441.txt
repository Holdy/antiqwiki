THE DULLAHAN.

    “Then wonder not at _headless folk_,
      Since every day you greet ’em;
    Nor treat old stories as a joke,
      When fools you daily meet ’em.”

                      —_The Legendary._

    “Says the friar, ’tis strange headless horses should trot.”

                                                    _Old Song._
