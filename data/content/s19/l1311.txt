HOW TO SING A “THREE MAN’S SONG.”

The “Three Man’s Song” was the precursor of the more familiar “Round.”
It should be sung in this manner: The first man sings, alone, the
opening line of each verse and as he proceeds with the second, the
second man starts to sing the first. In like manner the third man joins
in the harmony with the first line when the first man has reached the
third and the second man the second.

In order that all three singers should complete each verse at the same
time, it is necessary for the first man to repeat the first and the
second lines, and the second man to repeat the first line.

TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE


Obsolete, archaic and unusual spellings have been maintained as in the
original book. Obvious typos have been fixed silently.

In the story of John Dory, the phrase “in revenge of the great ravine
and cruelty” appears. The word “rapine” comes from French, and a
popular form of this word in old French was “ravine”. Consequently I
believe that a rendering of this phrase in modern English would be “in
revenge of the great rapine and cruelty.”
