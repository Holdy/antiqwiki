summary: Bronwen, a British princess, was married to the Irish king Matholwch, but after a series of insults and mistreatment, she was relegated to being a cook in his palace. Unable to communicate her plight to her brother Bran due to interference from the Irish, Bronwen ingeniously sent a message via a starling, prompting Bran to launch a rescue mission which led to a tragic battle where Bran died, and Bronwen survived him only briefly before passing away, broken-hearted.
