summary: In the hamlet of Ellenglaze, near Perran Bay, a young Lord builds a fourth hall, undeterred by warnings of the sands that previously consumed the area, but after a fierce storm and the threat of the sands approaching, his bride persuades him to spare an old witch, prompting a miraculous stream that saves the hall. This stream, created by tears from a kiss given by the bride to the old woman, prevents the sands from advancing, ensuring the safety of Ellenglaze as long as it continues to flow.
