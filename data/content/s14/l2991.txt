GHOULISM AND LYCANTHROPY

Sergeant Bertrand has also been declared a ghoul. Ghoulism bears a
somewhat closer resemblance than vampirism to lycanthropy. A ghoul is an
Elemental that visits any place where human or animal remains have been
interred. It digs them up and bites them, showing a keen liking for
brains, which it sucks in the same manner as a vampire sucks blood.

Ghouls either remain in spirit form or steal the bodies of living
beings--living beings only--either human or animal. They can only do
this when the spirit of the living person, during sleep (either natural
or induced hypnotically), is separated from the material body; or, in
other words, when the spirit is projected. The ghoul then pounces on the
physical body, and, often refusing to restore it to its rightful owner,
the latter is compelled to roam about as a phantasm for just so long a
time as the ghoul chooses to inhabit the body it has stolen.
