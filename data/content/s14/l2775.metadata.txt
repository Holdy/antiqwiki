summary: In 1603 Bordeaux, fourteen-year-old Jean Garnier was tried for lycanthropy, confessing to over fifty child murders and vividly recounting his transformations into a wolf to hunt isolated women and children. During one spree, he attacked a bathing girl whom he devoured over two days and once had to fight off a group of girls equipped with stakes when confronted by them.
