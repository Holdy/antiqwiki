THE OAKUM PICKERS

By L. S. Gibson, Author of 'The Heart of Desire.' Crown 8vo, 6s. [July

A story treating of modern social life, and incidentally of the
hardships inflicted by certain phases of the Divorce Laws upon the
innocent partner in an unhappy marriage. The two very dissimilar women
are well delineated and contrasted. Cynthia and Elizabeth, each in her
own way, are so human and sympathetic that the reader can hardly fail to
endorse the quotation on the title-page, 'I do not blame such women, but
for love they pick much oakum.' The men are drawn with no less strength
and sincerity; while Lady Juliet--the brilliant, heartless, little
mondaine who precipitates the tragedy of three lives--is a thumb-nail
sketch of a fascinating, if worthless, type.
