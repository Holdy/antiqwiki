THE ROYAL ROAD: Being the Story of the Life, Death, and Resurrection of
Edward Hankey of London

By Alfred Ollivant, Author of 'Owd Bob.' Crown 8vo, 6s. [September

In the pages of this book the reader follows the courageous spirit of a
working man down the alley of life. We hear his laughter; share his
joys; and watch the heroic struggle of his soul against the circumstance
that is oppressing him. The book, remorseless in its representation of
things as they are, is strong in hope: for it finds its inspiration in
the Love that shall some day conquer the world. It is a story for all
who seek to succour our England in her distress. To read it is to
understand something of her troubles of this present time, and to have a
glimpse of the glory that shall be revealed in her. A stern book, it is
to those who read aright a joyful one. For it is a prophecy of dawn.
