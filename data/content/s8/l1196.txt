FOOTNOTES:

[16] According to a letter written by the poet Campbell to Mrs.
Fletcher, in 1833, and published in her Autobiography, it was thought
Shakspeare went in person to see this magic valley. 'It is no later than
yesterday,' wrote Campbell, 'that I discovered a probability--almost
near a certainty--that Shakspeare visited friends in the very town
(Brecon in Wales) where Mrs. Siddons was born, and that he there found
in a neighbouring glen, called "The Valley of Fairy Puck," the principal
machinery of his "Midsummer Night's Dream."'
