The lesson of generosity is taught with force and simplicity in the
legend of Hafod Lwyddog, and the necessity for secrecy is quite
abandoned. Again it is a shepherd, who dwelt at Cwm Dyli, and who went
every summer to live in a cabin by the Green Lake (Llyn Glas) along
with his fold. One morning on awaking from sleep he saw a good-looking
damsel dressing an infant close by his side. She had very little in
which to wrap the babe, so he threw her an old shirt of his own, and
bade her place it about the child. She thanked him and departed. Every
night thereafter the shepherd found a piece of silver placed in an
old clog in his cabin. Years and years this good luck continued, and
Meirig the shepherd became immensely wealthy. He married a lovely
girl, and went to the Hafod Lwyddog to live. Whatever he undertook
prospered--hence the name Hafod Lwyddog, for Lwydd means prosperity.
The fairies paid nightly visits to the Hafod. No witch or evil sprite
could harm this people, as Bendith y Mamau was poured down upon the
family, and all their descendants.[60]
