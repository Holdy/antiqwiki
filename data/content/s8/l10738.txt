Several wells appear to have been devoted to the cure of the lower
animals' diseases. Such was the well of Cynfran, where this
ejaculation was made use of: 'Rhad Duw a Chynfran lwydd ar y
da!'--(the grace of God and the blessed Cynfran on the cattle.) This
Cynfran was one of the many sons of the patriarch Brychan, and his
well is near Abergeleu. Pennant speaks also of a well near Abergeleu,
which he calls St. George's well, and says that there the British Mars
had his offering of horses; 'for the rich were wont to offer one, to
secure his blessing on all the rest. He was the tutelar saint of those
animals.'
