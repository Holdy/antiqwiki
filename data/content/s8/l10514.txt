VI.

Among the many legends of Llandaff which still linger familiarly on
the lips of the people is that of the bell of St. Oudoceus, second
bishop of that see. In the ancient 'Book of Llandaff,' where are
preserved the records of that cathedral from the earliest days of
Christianity on this island, the legend is thus related: 'St.
Oudoceus, being thirsty after undergoing labour, and more accustomed
to drink water than any other liquor, came to a fountain in the vale
of Llandaff, not far from the church, that he might drink, where he
found women washing butter, after the manner of the country; and
sending to them his messengers and disciples, they requested that they
would accommodate them with a vessel, that their pastor might drink
therefrom; who, ironically, as mischievous girls, said, "We have no
cup besides that which we hold in our hands, namely, the butter." And
the man of blessed memory taking it, formed one in the shape of a
small bell, and he raised his hand so that he might drink therefrom,
and he drank. And it remained in that form, that is, a golden one, so
that it appeared to those who beheld it to consist altogether of the
purest gold, which, by divine power, is from that day reverently
preserved in the church of Llandaff in memory of the holy man, and it
is said that by touching it health is given to the diseased.'[160]
