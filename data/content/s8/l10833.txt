Another well whose specialty is warts is a small spring called Ffynon
Gwynwy, near Llangelynin church, Carnarvonshire. The pins used here
must be crooked in order to be efficacious. It is said that fifty
years ago the bottom of this little well was covered with pins; and
that everybody was careful not to touch them, fearing that the warts
deposited with the pins would grow upon their own hands if they did
so.[166] At present the well is overgrown with weeds, like that on
Barry Island.
