QUAINT OLD CUSTOMS.

    Where in an agede cell with moss and iveye growne,
    In which nor to this daye the sunn had ever showne,
    Their reverend British saint, in zealous ages paste,
    To contemplation lived, and did so truly faste,
    As he did onlie drink what chrystal [rivers] yields,
    And fed upon the leakes he gather'd in the fields:
    In memory of whom, in the revolving year,
    The Welchman on that daye that sacred herb doth wear.
