summary: The Welsh folklore emphasizes that fairy gifts, like money or bread, are as good as gold if kept secret; revealing them causes them to revert to worthless forms. Gitto Bach, a farmer's boy, vanished for two years playing with mysterious children on a mountain, and returned with fanciful clothes that turned out to be mere paper.
