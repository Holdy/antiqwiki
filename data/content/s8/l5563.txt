That giants should appear in the Welsh spirit-land will surprise no
one, but the apparition of black men is more unique. The Mabinogion,
however, are full of black men, usually giants, always terrible to
encounter. The black man whom Peredur slew had but one eye, having
lost the other in fighting with the black serpent of the Carn. 'There
is a mound, which is called the Mound of Mourning; and on the mound
there is a carn, and in the carn there is a serpent, and on the tail
of the serpent there is a stone, and the virtues of the stone are
such, that whosoever should hold it in one hand, in the other he will
have as much gold as he may desire. And in fighting with this serpent
was it that I lost my eye.'[73] In the 'Lady of the Fountain' mabinogi
the same character appears: 'a black man ... not smaller in size than
two of the men of this world,' and with 'one eye in the middle of his
forehead.'[74] And there are other black men in other Mabinogion,
indicating the extremely ancient lineage of the spectre seen by Anne
Jenkins at the Fountain of the Spirit. Whatever Anglo-Saxon scoffers
may say of Welsh pedigrees of mere flesh and blood, the antiquity of
its spectral hordes may not be disputed. The black giant of Sindbad
the Sailor and the monster woodward of Cynan alike descend from the
Polyphemus blinded by Odysseus.
