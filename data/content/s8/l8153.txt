Shrove Tuesday was once characterised by a custom called throwing at
cocks, now obsolete. Hens which had laid no eggs before that day were
threshed with a flail, as being good for nothing. The person who hit
the hen with the flail and killed her got her for his reward.

The more reputable custom of cramming with crammwythau (pancakes)
still survives, and is undoubtedly of extreme antiquity.
