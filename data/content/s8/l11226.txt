IV.

In the church of St. David's of Llanfaes, according to Giraldus, was
preserved among the relics a stone which caught a thieving boy in the
act of robbing a pigeon's nest, and held him fast for three days and
nights. Only by assiduous and long-continued prayer were the unhappy
boy's parents able to get him loose from the terrible stone, and the
marks of his five fingers remained ever after impressed upon it, so
that all might see them. There was a stone of similar proclivities in
the valley of Mowddwy, which did good service for the church. A
certain St. Tydecho, a relation of King Arthur, who slept on a blue
rock in this valley, was persecuted by Maelgwn Gwynedd. One day this
wicked knight came with a pack of white dogs to hunt in that
neighbourhood, and sat down upon the saint's blue stone. When he
endeavoured to get up he found himself fastened to his seat so that he
could not stir, in a manner absurdly suggestive of French farces; and
he was obliged to make up matters with the saint. He ceased to
persecute the good man, and to make amends for the past gave him the
privilege of sanctuary for a hundred ages.[176]
