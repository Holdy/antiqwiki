[79] Let me recommend the scene of this story to tourists. It is a
most romantic spot, on the top of a mountain, a glorious tramp from
Crumlyn, returning by another road to Abercarne. Wheels cannot go
there, though a sure-footed horse might bear one safely up. The
ancient farm-house is one of the quaintest in Wales, and must be
hundreds of years old; and its front porch looks out over a ravine
hardly less grand and lonely than a Californian gulch.
