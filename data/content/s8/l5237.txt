I.

Of spectral animals there is no great diversity in Cambria, unless one
should class under this head sundry poetic creatures which more
properly belong to the domain of magic, or to fairyland. The spirits
of favourite animals which have died return occasionally to visit
their masters. Sometimes it is a horse, which is seen on a dark night
looking in at the window, its eyes preternaturally large. More often
it is the ghost of a dog which revisits the glimpses of the moon. Men
sometimes become as fondly attached to a dog as they could to any
human being, and, where the creed of piety is not too severe, the
possibility of a dog's surviving after death in a better world is
admitted. 'It is hard to look in that dog's eyes and believe,' said a
Welshman to me, 'that he has not a bit of a soul to be saved.' The
almost human companionship of the dog for man is a familiar fact. It
is not strange, therefore, that the dog should be the animal whose
spirit, in popular belief, shares the nature of man's after death.
