Transcriber's Note

Minor punctuation errors have been repaired.

Hyphenation and accent usage has been made consistent throughout.
Capitalisation of items in the Table of contents and chapter headers
has been made consistent.

On page 181, following an account of the damage caused by spirits is
the line "This pleasant experience was often repeated." The word
'pleasant' may be an error on the part of the author or typesetter,
and 'unpleasant' was actually intended, or it may be deliberate on the
part of the author. Since it is impossible to be sure, it is preserved
as printed.

or inconsistency:
