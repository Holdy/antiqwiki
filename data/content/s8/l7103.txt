V.

One of the most beautiful legends in the Iolo MSS. gives an ancient
tale of the Tolaeth which may be thus condensed: A great and wealthy
lord, rich in land, houses and gold, enjoying all the luxuries of
life, heard a voice proclaim thrice distinctly: 'The greatest and
richest man of this parish shall die to-night.' At this he was sadly
troubled, for he knew that the greatest and richest man of that parish
could be no other than he; so he sent for the physician, but made
ready for death. Great, however, was his joy when the night passed,
the day broke, and he was yet alive. At sunrise the church bell was
heard tolling, and the lord sent in haste to know who was dead. Answer
came that it was an old blind beggar man, who had asked, and been
refused, alms at the great man's gate. Then the lord knew the meaning
of the warning voice he had heard: that very great and very rich man
had been the poor beggar--his treasures and wealth in the kingdom of
heaven. He took the warning wisely to heart, endowed religious houses,
relieved all who were in poverty, and when at last he was dying, the
voices of angels were heard to sing a hymn of welcome; and he was
buried, according to his desire, in the old beggar's grave.[101]
