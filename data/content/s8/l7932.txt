IV.

Connected with St. Valentine's Day, there is no Welsh custom which
demands notice here; but it is perhaps worthy of mention that nowhere
in the world is the day more abundantly productive of its orthodox
crop--love-letters. The post-offices in the Principality are simply
deluged with these missives on the eve and morning of St. Valentine's.
In Cardiff the postmaster thinks himself lucky if he gets off with
fifteen thousand letters in excess of the ordinary mail. Nineteen
extra sorters and carriers were employed for this work on February
14th, 1878, and the regular force also was heavily worked beyond its
usual hours. The custom is more Norman than Cambrian, I suppose; the
word Valentine comes from the Norman word for a lover, and the saint
is a mere accident in this connection.
