summary: In a tale set in Wales, the devil is said to have interacted with monks of Tintern Abbey by preaching from a rocky outcrop known as the Devil's Pulpit, only to be driven away by a surprise dousing of holy water. The superstition that chalked doorsteps can keep evil at bay underscores the narrative's theme of folklore and beliefs about the devil's presence in the region.
