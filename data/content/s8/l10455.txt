IV.

The legend of the Bell of Rhayader perpetuates a class of story which
reappears in other parts of Great Britain. It was in the twelfth
century that a certain contumacious knight was imprisoned in the
castle of Rhayader. His wife, being devoted to him, and a good
Catholic, besought the aid of the monks to get him out. They were
equal to the occasion, at least in so far as to provide for her
service a magical bell, which possessed the power of liberating from
confinement any prisoner who should set it up on the wall and ring it.
The wife succeeded in getting the bell secretly into her husband's
possession, and he set it up on the wall and rang it. But although he
had gathered his belongings together and was fully prepared to go, the
doors of his prison refused to open. The castellan mocked at the
magical bell, and kept the knight in durance vile. So therefore (for
of course the story could not be allowed to end here) the castle was
struck by lightning, and both it and the town were burned in one
night--excepting only the wall upon which the magic bell was hanging.
Nothing remains of the castle walls in this day.
