The gigantic stone-tossers of Wales associate themselves without
effort with the mythology of the heavens. One of their chiefest,
Idris, was indeed noted as an astrologer, and is celebrated as such in
the Triads:

    Idris Gawr, or the Giant Idris;
    Gwydion, or the Diviner by Trees;
    Gwyn, the Son of Nudd, the Generous;
    So great was their knowledge of the stars, that they could foretell
            whatever might be desired to be known until the day of doom.

And among Welsh legends none is more familiar than that of Rhitta
Gawr, wherein the stars are familiarly spoken of as cows and sheep,
and the firmament as their pasture.
