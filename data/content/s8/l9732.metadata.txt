summary: In a rural village in Glamorganshire, a custom called the Coolstrin involved a mock trial for husbands suspected of having overbearing wives, culminating in a derisive parade to publicly shame the family. The comical but harsh proceedings included a mock court with role-playing and a noisy procession through the town, designed to reform behavior by exposing the couple to ridicule.
