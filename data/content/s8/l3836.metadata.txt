summary: The Pwca, a mythical creature, left its original home at Pantygasseg in a jug of barm, declaring it would never return, and indeed, it was never heard there again. In another tale, the Pwca transferred itself into a ball of yarn and rolled across the valley to its new home, Trwyn Farm, never to return to its previous residence.
