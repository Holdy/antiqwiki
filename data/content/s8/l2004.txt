[33] 'Juan (Shu√Ø) White is an old acquaintance of my boyhood,' writes
to me a friend who was born some thirty years ago in Monmouthshire. 'A
ruined cottage on the Lasgarn hill near Pontypool was understood by us
boys to have been her house, and there she appeared at 12 p.m.,
carrying her head under her arm.'
