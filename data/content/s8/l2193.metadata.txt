summary: In Glamorganshire, a tale is told of a mother advised to prepare a meal for ten using only an egg-shell to reveal a changeling baby, resulting in the fairy returning her real child. Remarkably, this story's rhymed triad aligns with a Breton legend, suggesting its origins predate the seventh-century separation of Welsh and Armorican Britons.
