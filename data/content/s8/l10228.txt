VIII.

Until a recent date, burials without a coffin were common in some
parts of Wales. Old people in Montgomeryshire not many years ago,
could remember such burials, in what was called the cadach deupen, or
cloth with two heads. Old Richard Griffith, of Trefeglwys, who died
many years ago, recollected a burial in this fashion there, when the
cloth gave way and was rent; whereupon the clergyman prohibited any
further burials in that churchyard without a coffin. That was the last
burial of the kind which took place in Montgomeryshire.[155]

In the middle ages there was a Welsh custom of burying the dead in the
garment of a monk, as a protection against evil spirits. This was
popular among the wealthy, and was a goodly source of priestly
revenue.
