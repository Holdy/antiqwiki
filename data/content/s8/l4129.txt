II.

The so-called Pwca'r Trwyn, which haunted the farm-house in the parish
of Mynyddyslwyn, is sometimes cited as another case in which a fairy
was probably a being of flesh and blood; and if this be true, it of
course proves nothing but the adoption of an ancient superstition by a
proscribed Welsh nobleman. There is a tradition that this fairy had a
name, and that this name was 'yr Arglwydd Hywel,' which is in English
'Lord Howell.' And it is argued that this Lord, in a contest with the
forces of the English king, was utterly worsted, and driven into
hiding; that his tenants at Pantygasseg and the Trwyn Farm, loving
their Lord, helped to hide him, and to disseminate the belief that he
was a household fairy, or Bwbach. It is related that he generally
spoke from his own room in this farm-house, in a gentle voice which
'came down between the boards' into the common room beneath. One day
the servants were comparing their hands, as to size and whiteness,
when the fairy was heard to say, 'The Pwca's hand is the fairest and
smallest.' The servants asked if the fairy would show its hand, and
immediately a plank overhead was moved and a hand appeared, small,
fair and beautifully formed, with a large gold ring on the little
finger.
