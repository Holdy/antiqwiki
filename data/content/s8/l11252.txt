As for Stones of Healing, with qualities resembling those abiding in
certain wells, they appear in many shapes. Now it is a maenhir,
against which the afflicted peasant must rub himself; now it is a
pebble which he must carry in his pocket. The inevitable wart
reappears in this connection; the stone which cures the wart is found
by the roadside, wrapped in a bit of paper, and dropped on a
cross-road; to him who picks it up the wart is transferred. Children
in Pembrokeshire will not at the present day pick up a small parcel on
a cross-road, suspecting the presence of the wart-bearing stone. In
Carmarthen are still to be found traces of a belief in the Alluring
Stone, whose virtue is that it will cure hydrophobia. It is
represented as a soft white stone, about the size of a man's head,
originally found on a farm called Dysgwylfa, about twelve miles from
Carmarthen town. Grains were scraped from the stone with a knife, and
administered to the person who had been bitten by a rabid dog; and a
peculiarity of the stone was that though generation after generation
had scraped it, nevertheless it did not diminish in size. A woman who
ate of this miraculous stone, after having been bitten by a suspicious
cur, testified that it caused 'a boiling in her blood.' The stone was
said to have fallen from the sky in the first instance.
