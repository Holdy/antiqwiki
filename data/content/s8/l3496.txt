IV.

This observation respecting the mysterious language used by fairies
recalls again the medieval story of Elidurus. The example of fairy
words there given by Giraldus is thought by the learned rector of
Llanarmon[51] to be 'a mixture of Irish and Welsh. The letter U, with
which each of the words begins, is, probably, no more than the
representative of an indistinct sound like the E mute of the French,
and which those whose language and manners are vulgar often prefix to
words indifferently. If, then, they be read dor dorum, and halgein
dorum, dor and halgein are nearly dwr (or, as it is pronounced, door)
and halen, the Welsh words for water and salt respectively. Dorum
therefore is equivalent to "give me," and the Irish expression for
"give me" is thorum; the Welsh dyro i mi. The order of the words,
however, is reversed. The order should be thorum dor, and thorum halen
in Irish, and in Welsh dyro i mi ddwr, and dyro i mi halen, but was,
perhaps, reversed intentionally by the narrator, to make his tale the
more marvellous.'[52]
