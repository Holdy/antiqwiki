VIII.

The only other instance given by the Prophet Jones as from the depths
of his own personal experience, is more vague in its particulars than
the preceding, and happened when he had presumably grown to years of
discretion. He was led astray, it appears, by the Old Woman of the
Mountain, on Llanhiddel Bryn, near Pontypool--an eminence with which
he was perfectly well acquainted, and which 'is no more than a mile
and a half long and about half a mile broad.' But as a result of his
going astray, he came to a house where he had never been before; and
being deeply moved by his uncanny experience, 'offered to go to
prayer, which they admitted.... I was then about twenty-three years of
age and had begun to preach the everlasting gospel. They seemed to
admire that a person so young should be so warmly disposed; few young
men of my age being religious in this country then. Much good came
into this house and still continues in it.... So the old hag got
nothing by leading me astray that time.'
