The circles in the grass of green fields, which are commonly called
fairy rings, are numerous in Wales, and it is deemed just as well to
keep out of them, even in our day. The peasantry no longer believe
that the fairies can be seen dancing there, nor that the cap of
invisibility will fall on the head of one who enters the circle; but
they do believe that the fairies, in a time not long gone, made these
circles with the tread of their tripping feet, and that some
misfortune will probably befall any person intruding upon this
forbidden ground. An old man at Peterstone-super-Ely told me he well
remembered in his childhood being warned by his mother to keep away
from the fairy rings. The counsel thus given him made so deep an
impression on his mind, that he had never in his life entered one. He
remarked further, in answer to a question, that he had never walked
under a ladder, because it was unlucky to walk under a ladder. This
class of superstitions is a very large one, and is encountered the
world over; and the fairy rings seem to fall into this class, so far
as present-day belief in Wales is concerned.
