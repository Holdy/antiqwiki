III.

The ghosts of Wales present many well-defined features. It is even
possible to classify them, after a fashion. Of course, as with all
descriptions of phantoms, the vagueness inevitable in creatures of the
imagination is here; but the ghosts of Welsh tradition are often so
old, and have been handed down so cleanly through successive
generations, that in our day they have almost acquired definite
outlines, as in the case of images arising from the perceptions.
Always bearing in mind the risk of being lost in the labyrinthine
eccentricities of popular fancy, compared to which the ArsinoÃ« of
Herodotus was unperplexing, I venture to classify the inhabitants of
the Welsh spirit-world thus: 1. Departed Mortals; 2. Goblin Animals;
3. Spectres of Natural Objects; 4. Grotesque Ghosts; 5. Familiar
Spirits; 6. Death Omens.
