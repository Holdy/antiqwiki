Wearing mourning throughout Lent was formerly common in Wales. In
Monmouthshire, Mothering Sunday--the visiting of parents on Mid-Lent
Sunday--was observed in the last century, but is nowhere popular in
Wales at present. Palm Sunday takes precedence among the Welsh, and is
very extensively and enthusiastically observed. The day is called
Flowering Sunday, and its peculiar feature is strewing the graves of
the dead with flowers. The custom reaches all classes, and all parts
of the Principality. In the large towns, as Cardiff, many thousands of
people gather at the graves. The custom is associated with the
strewing of palms before Christ on his entry into Jerusalem, but was
observed by the British Druids in celebration of the awakening life of
the earth at this season.
