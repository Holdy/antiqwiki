BOOK II.

THE SPIRIT-WORLD.

    Where the wan spectres walk eternal rounds.
                    POPE.

    _Miranda._ What is't? a spirit?
               Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
               It carries a brave form:--But 'tis a spirit.
                    SHAKSPEARE: _Tempest_.
