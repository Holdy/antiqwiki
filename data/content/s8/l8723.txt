November the Fifth, the anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot, is much
observed in Wales. 'God grant,' said Bishop Sanderson in one of his
sermons, 'that we nor ours ever live to see November the Fifth
forgotten, or the solemnity of it silenced.' The words are similar to
those used by a great American, of the early days of the Republic,
with regard to the 4th of July--God grant it might never be forgotten.
But the rites by which both days are celebrated are as old as
tradition, and much older than history. As the Americans have given a
historical significance to bonfires and fireworks, so the English
before them did to sacrificing a puppet on Guy Fawkes' Day; and so
again some Catholic nations have made the rite a religious one, in the
hanging of Judas. All three customs are traced to the same
original--the ancient Druidic sacrifices to the sun-god Beal or
Moloch. It is noteworthy that the Fifth of November and the Fourth of
July--or rather the fiery features of these days--are alike voted a
nuisance by respectable and steady-going people in the countries to
which they respectively belong.
