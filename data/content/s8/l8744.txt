VI.

On St. Clement's Day (the 23rd of November) it was customary in
Pembrokeshire in the last century to parade an effigy of a carpenter,
which had been hung to the church steeple the night before. Cutting
the effigy down from where it hung, the people carried it about the
village, repeating loudly some doggerel verses which purported to be
the last will and testament of St. Clement, distributing to the
different carpenters in town the several articles of dress worn by the
effigy. After the image was thus stripped of its garments, one by one,
the padded remains were thrown down and carefully kicked to pieces by
the crowd.
