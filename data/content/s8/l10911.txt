Occasionally the cursing powers of a well were synonymous with curing
powers. Thus a well much resorted to near Penrhos, was able to curse a
cancer, i.e., cure it. The sufferer washed in the water, uttering
curses upon the disease, and also dropping pins around the well. This
well has been drained by the unsympathizing farmer on whose land it
was, on account of the serious damage done to his crops by
trespassers.
