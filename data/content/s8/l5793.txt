FOOTNOTES:

[75] For the sake of comparison, I give the latest American case which
comes under my notice. The scene is Akron, a bustling town in the
State of Ohio; the time October, 1878. 'Mr. and Mrs. Michael Metzler,
middle-aged Germans, with their little daughter, ten years of age, and
Mrs. Knoss, Metzler's mother-in-law, recently moved to a brick house
in the suburbs known as Hell's Half Acre. The house is a good,
substantial building, situated in a somewhat open space, and
surrounded by a lonesome deserted air. A few days after they had
moved, they were disturbed by sharp rappings all over the house,
produced by small stones or pebbles thrown against the window panes.
Different members of the family were hit by these stones coming to and
going from the house. Other persons were hit by them, the stones
varying in size from a pea to a hen's egg. Mrs. Metzler said that when
she went after the cow in the evening, she could hear these stones
whistling around her head. Mr. and Mrs. Metzler, who are devout
Catholics, had Father Brown come to the house to exorcise the spirits
which were tormenting them. The reverend father, in the midst of his
exercises, was struck by a stone, and so dismayed thereby that he went
home in despair.' (Newspaper account.)
