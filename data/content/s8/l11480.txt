The Sagranus Stone at St. Dogmell's, Pembrokeshire, was formerly used
as a bridge over a brook not far from where it at present
stands--luckily with its inscribed face downwards, so that the
sculpture remained unharmed while generations were tramping over it.
During its use as a bridge it bore the reputation of being haunted by
a white lady, who was constantly seen gliding over it at the witching
hour of midnight. No man or woman could be induced to touch the
strange stone after dark, and its supernatural reputation no doubt
helped materially in its preservation unharmed till the present time.
It is considered on paleographic grounds to be of the fourth century.

In Pembrokeshire also are found the famous Dancing Stones of
Stackpool. These are three upright stones standing about a mile from
each other, the first at Stackpool Warren, the second further to the
west, on a stone tumulus in a field known as Horestone Park, and the
third still further westward. One of many traditions concerning them
is to the effect that on a certain day they meet and come down to
Sais's Ford to dance, and after their revel is over return home and
resume their places.
