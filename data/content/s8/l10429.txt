III.

The Welsh were formerly strong in the belief that bells could perform
miracles, detect thieves, heal the sick, and the like. In many
instances they were possessed of locomotive powers, and would
transport themselves from place to place when they had occasion,
according to their own sweet will, and without human intervention. It
is even recorded that certain handbells required to be tied with the
double cord of an exorcism and a piece of twine, or they would get up
and walk off in the night.

Bells which presaged storms, as well as other disasters, have been
believed to exist in many parts of Wales. In Pembrokeshire the
unexpected tolling of a church bell in the night is held to be the
sure precursor of a calamity--a belief which may be paralleled in
London, where there are still people who believe such tolling on the
part of the great bell of St. Paul's portends disaster to the royal
family. In the Cromwellian wars, the sacrilegious followers of the
stern old castle-hater carried off a great bell from St. David's,
Pembrokeshire. They managed to get it on shipboard, but in passing
through Ramsey Sound the vessel was wrecked--a direct result, the
superstitious said, of profanely treating the bell. Ever since that
time, Pembroke people have been able to hear this sunken bell ring
from its watery grave when a storm is rising.
