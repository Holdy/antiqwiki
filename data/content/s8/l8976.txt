III.

In the family circle, the rules which regulate the Sabbath in
Wales--which are almost as repressive as those of bonnie Scotland,
where, by the way, Christmas-day is scarcely observed at all--are
relaxed, and the aspect of the home is as bright as can be. The rooms
are elaborately decorated with flowers and evergreens, holly and ivy,
ferns and rare plants. In Glamorganshire, and other of the southern
counties looking on the sea, roses and hawthorn-sprays may be
sometimes seen in full bloom out-of-doors at Christmas. The decoration
of churches is also elaborate beyond anything I have elsewhere seen.
It is a sight to behold, the preparations for and the work of
decorating a vast pile of ecclesiastical buildings like Llandaff
Cathedral--the huge quantities of evergreens and holly, flowers,
cedars, etc., which are day by day accumulated by the ladies who have
the business in charge; and the slow, continual growth of forms of
grace--arches, crosses, wreaths, festoons; green coverings to font,
altar, pulpit, choir-stalls, pillars, reredos, and rood-screen; panels
faced with scarlet cloth bearing sacred devices worked in evergreen;
the very window-sills glowing with banks of colour--until all the wide
spaces in chancel, nave, and transepts, are adorned.
