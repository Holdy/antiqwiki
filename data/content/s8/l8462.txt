VII.

In the remote and primitive parish of Defynog, in Breconshire, until a
few years since, a custom survived of carrying the King of Summer and
the King of Winter. Two boys were chosen to serve as the two kings,
and were covered all over with a dress of brigau bedw, (birchen
boughs,) only their faces remaining visible. A coin was tossed and the
boy chosen was the summer king; a crown of bright-hued ribbons was put
upon his head. Upon the other boy's head was placed a crown of holly,
to designate the winter king. Then a procession was formed, headed by
two men with drawn swords to clear the way. Four men supported the
summer king upon two poles, one under his knees and the other under
his arms; and four others bore the winter king in a similar
undignified posture. The procession passed round the village and to
the farm-houses near by, collecting largess of coin or beer, winding
up the perambulation at the churchyard. Here the boys were set free,
and received a dole for their services, the winter king getting less
than the other.

Another May-day custom among the boys of that parish, was to carry
about a rod, from which the bark had been partly peeled in a spiral
form, and upon the top of which was set either a cock or a cross, the
bearers waking the echoes of the village with 'Yo ho! yo ho! yo
ho!'[128]
