IV.

Another grotesque Welsh goblin goes whirling through the world. Three
examples are given by the Prophet Jones. _First:_ Lewis Thomas, the
father of the Rev. Thomas Lewis, was on his return from a journey, and
in passing through a field near Bedwellty, saw this dreadful
apparition, to wit, the spectre of a man walking or whirling along on
its hands and feet; at sight of which Lewis Thomas felt his hair to
move on his head; his heart panted and beat violently, 'his body
trembled, and he felt not his clothes about him,' _Second:_ John
Jenkins, a poor man, who lived near Abertillery, hanged himself in a
hay-loft. His sister soon after came upon his dead body there hanging,
and screamed loudly. Jeremiah James, who lived in Abertillery House,
hearing the scream, looked in that direction and saw the 'resemblance
of a man' coming from the hay-loft 'and violently turning upwards and
downwards topsy turvy' towards the river, 'which was a dreadful sight
to a serious godly man.' _Third:_ Thomas Andrew, living at a place
called The Farm, in the parish of Lanhiddel, coming home late at night
saw a whirling goblin on all fours by the side of a wall, which fell
to scraping the ground and wagging its head, 'looking aside one way
and the other,' making at the same time a horrible mowing noise; at
which Thomas Andrew 'was terribly frightened.'
