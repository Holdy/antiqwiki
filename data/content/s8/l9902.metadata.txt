summary: The Sin-eater ritual, a supposed funeral custom in Wales and nearby regions, involves a person consuming bread and beer over the deceased to absorb their sins, but historical evidence and local Welsh writings largely omit any mention of such a tradition, leading to skepticism about its authenticity. Despite accounts from the 17th century and mentions by later antiquarians, many well-informed Welsh people deny the existence of the Sin-eater custom, and its validity remains questionable due to lack of corroborative evidence.
