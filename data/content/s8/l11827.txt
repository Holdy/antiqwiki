II.

A hollow in the road near Caerau, in Cardiganshire, 'rings when any
wheeled vehicle goes over it.' Early in this century, two men having
been led to believe that there were treasures hidden there (for a
fairy in the semblance of a gipsy had appeared and thrown out hints on
the fascinating subject from time to time), made up their minds to dig
for it. They dug accordingly until they came, by their solemn
statement, to the oaken frame of a subterranean doorway; and feeling
sure now, that they had serious work before them, prepared for the
same by going to dinner. They had no sooner gone than a terrible storm
arose; the rain fell in torrents, the thunder pealed and the lightning
flashed. When they went back to their work, the hole they had digged
was closed up; and nothing would convince them that this was done by
any other than a supernatural agency. Moreover, but a little above the
place where they were, there had been no rain at all.[184]
