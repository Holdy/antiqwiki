summary: Evan Thomas, while traveling by night over Bedwellty Mountain, drove away the Gwyllion by drawing his knife, a common exorcism method in Wales. This event reflects a broader European superstition that knives play a crucial role in warding off unwelcome spirits and cutting ties, with such beliefs even extending to parts of America and China.
