summary: The Gwyllion, fearsome female fairies, haunt the Welsh mountains leading travelers astray, often taking the form of the Old Woman of the Mountain who appears as a ghostly figure causing wanderers to lose their way. This apparition is said to be the spirit of a witch named Juan White, and while being chased, she vanishes when a knife is drawn, as Welsh fairies fear knives.
