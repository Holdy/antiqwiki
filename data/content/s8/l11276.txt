VI.

Stones standing at cross-roads are seldom without some superstitious
legend. A peasant pointed out to me, on a mountain-top near Crumlyn,
Monmouthshire, a cross-roads stone, beneath which, he asserted, a
witch sleeps by day, coming forth at night. 'Least they was say so,'
he explained, with a nervous look about him, 'but there you! _I_ was
never see anything, an' I was pass by there many nights--yes, indeed,
often.' The man's eagerness to testify against the truth of the
tradition was one of the most impressive illustrations possible of
lingering superstitious awe in this connection.

A famous Welsh witch, who used to sleep under a stone at Llanberis, in
North Wales, was called Canrig Bwt, and her favourite dish at dinner
was children's brains. A certain criminal who had received a
death-sentence was given the alternative of attacking this frightful
creature, his life to be spared should he succeed in destroying her.
Arming himself with a sharp sword, the doomed man got upon the stone
and called on Canrig to come out. 'Wait till I have finished eating
the brains in this sweet little skull,' was her horrible answer.
However, forth she came presently, when the valiant man cut off her
head at a blow. To this day they scare children thereabout with the
name of Canrig Bwt.
