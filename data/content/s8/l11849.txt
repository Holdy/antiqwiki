III.

There is a current belief among the peasants about Moel Arthur--a
mountain overlooking the Vale of Clwyd--that treasure, concealed in an
iron chest with a ring-handle to it, lies buried there. The place of
concealment is often illuminated at night by a supernatural light.
Several people thereabouts are known to have seen the light, and there
are even men who will tell you that bold adventurers have so far
succeeded as to grasp the handle of the iron chest, when an outburst
of wild tempest wrested it from their hold and struck them senseless.
Local tradition points out the place as the residence of an ancient
prince, and as a spot charmed against the spade of the antiquary.
'Whoever digs there,' said an old woman in Welsh to some men going
home from their work on this spot, after a drenching wet day, 'is
always driven away by thunder and lightning and storm; you have been
served like everybody else who has made the attempt.'
