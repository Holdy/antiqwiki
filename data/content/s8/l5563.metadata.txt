summary: The Mabinogion are rich with tales of black men, often giants, who are formidable adversaries, like the one-eyed black man Peredur slew after a fight with a black serpent. These figures suggest a long-standing tradition of terrifying entities in Welsh folklore, which parallels mythical creatures from other cultures, such as the giant of Sindbad the Sailor and Polyphemus from Odysseus's tales.
