FOOTNOTES:

[82] In his fascinating essay on the 'Folk-Lore of France,' in the
'Folk-Lore Record' for 1878 (published by the Folk-Lore Society) Mr.
A. Lang says: 'So widespread is this superstition, that a friend of
mine declares he has met with it among the savages of New Caledonia,
and has known a native who actually died, as he himself said he would,
after meeting one of the fairy women of the wild wood.'

[84] 'The Life and Death of Mr. Vavasor Powell,' p. 8. (A curious
seventeenth century book, no two existing copies of which appear to be
alike. I here cite from that in the library of the Marquis of Bute,
than which a more perfect copy is rarely met with.)
