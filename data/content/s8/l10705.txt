Of great celebrity in other days was St. Dwynwen's well, in the parish
of Llandwyn, Anglesea. This saint being patron saint of lovers, her
well possessed the property of curing love-sickness. It was visited by
great numbers, of both sexes, in the fourteenth century, when the
popular faith in its waters seems to have been at its strongest. It is
still frequented by young women of that part of the country when
suffering from the woes inflicted by Dan Cupid. That the well itself
has been for many years covered over with sand does not prevent the
faithful from displaying their devotion; they seek their cure from
'the water next to the well.' Ffynon Dwynwen, or Fountain of Venus,
was also a name given to the sea, according to the Iolo MSS.; and in
the legend of Seithenhin the Drunkard, in the 'Black Book of
Carmarthen,' this stanza occurs:

    Accursed be the damsel,
    Who, after the wailing,
    Let loose the Fountain of Venus, the raging deep.[162]

The story of Aphrodite, born from the foam of the sea, need only be
alluded to here.

Hengwrt collection, which belonged of old to the priory of Black
Canons at Carmarthen, and at the dissolution of the religious houses
in Wales, when their libraries were dispersed, was given by the
treasurer of St. David's Church to Sir John Price, one of Henry
VIII.'s commissioners.)
