VIII.

The devil with which we are acquainted is a character unknown to Greek
or Roman mythology; this devil was a later invention; but his identity
with the genii, or jinns of the 'Arabian Nights,' the DÃ¯vs of Persian
history, is clear enough. Ahriman, the evil spirit, king of the realms
of darkness and of fire, was apparently the progenitor of Satan, as
Vritra was of Ahriman. Both these ancient arch-fiends appeared as
serpents in form, and were myths representing the darkness, slain by
the light, or the sun-god, in the one case called Indra, in the other
Ormuzd. The medieval devil with horns and hoofs does not appear in the
records of Judaism. He is an outgrowth of the moral principle of the
Christian era; and traced to his origins he is simply a
personification of the adversary in the never-ending struggle on earth
between light and darkness. That struggle is not, in nature, a moral
one; but it remains to-day, as it was in the beginning, the best type
we have of the battle between right and wrong, and between truth and
error. When God said, 'Let there be light,' the utterance became the
symbol and guide of virtue, of brave endeavour, and of scientific
research, until the end.
