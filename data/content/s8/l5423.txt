Confined to the coast, too, are those stories of phantom ships and
phantom islands which, too familiar to merit illustration here, have
their origin in the mirage. That they also touch the ancient mythology
is undoubted; but their source in the mirage is probably true of the
primeval belief as well as of the medieval, and that of our time. The
Chinese also have the mirage, but not its scientific explanation, and
hence of course their belief in its supernatural character is
undisturbed.
