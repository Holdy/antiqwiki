VIII.

In a field called Parc-y-Bigwrn, near Llanboidy, Carmarthenshire, are
the remains of a cromlech destroyed many years ago, concerning which
an old man named John Jones related a superstitious tale. It was to
the effect that there were ten men engaged in the work of throwing it
down, and that when they were touching the stone they became filled
with awe; and moreover, as the stone was being drawn away by six
horses the road was suddenly rent asunder in a supernatural manner.
This is a frequent phenomenon supposed by the Welsh peasantry to
accompany the attempt to move a cromlech. Another common catastrophe
is the breaking down of the waggon--not from the weight of the stone,
but through the displeasure of its goblin guardians. Sometimes this
awful labour is accompanied by fierce storms of hail and wind, or
violent thunder and lightning; sometimes by mysterious noises, or
swarms of bees which are supposed to be fairies in disguise.
