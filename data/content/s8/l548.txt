BOOK I.

THE REALM OF FAERIE.

    At eve, the primrose path along,
    The milkmaid shortens with a song
          Her solitary way;
    She sees the fairies with their queen
    Trip hand-in-hand the circled green,
    And hears them raise, at times unseen,
          The ear-enchanting lay.
                    REV. JOHN LOGAN: _Ode to Spring_, 1780.
