In all these legends the student of comparative folk-lore traces the
ancient mythology, however overlain with later details. The
water-maidens of every land doubtless originally were the floating
clouds of the sky, or the mists of the mountain. From this have come
certain fair and fanciful creations with which Indo-European folk-lore
teems, the most familiar of which are Undine, Melusina, Nausicaa, and
the classic Muse. In Wales, as in other lands, the myth has many
forms. The dispersion of dark clouds from the mountains, by the beams
of the rising sun, or the morning breezes, is localized in the legend
of the Men of Ardudwy. These men make a raid on the maidens of the
Vale of Clwyd, and are pursued and slaughtered by the latter's fathers
and brothers. The maidens thereupon cast themselves headlong into the
lake, which is thenceforth called the Maidens' Lake, or Llyn y
Morwynion. In another legend, the river mist over the Cynwal is the
spirit of a traitress who perished long ago in the lake. She had
conspired with the sea-born pirates of the North (the ocean storms) to
rob her Cambrian lord of his domains. She was defeated by the aid of a
powerful enchanter (the sun), and fled up the river to the lake,
accompanied by her maidens, who were drowned with her there.[29]
