[148] Mr. Eugene Schuyler's mention of a corresponding character in
Turkistan is interesting: 'One poor old man, however, I noticed, who
seemed constantly engaged in prayer. On calling attention to him I was
told that he was an iskatchi, a person who gets his living by taking
on himself the sins of the dead, and thenceforth devoting himself to
prayer for their souls. He corresponds to the Sin-eater of the Welsh
border.'--'Turkistan,' ii., 28.
