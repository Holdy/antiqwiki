Reference has been made, in the chapter on courtship and marriage, to
the Welsh practice of planting graves with flowers. There are graves
in Glamorganshire which have been kept blooming with flowers for
nearly a century without interruption, through the loving care of
descendants of the departed. By a most graceful custom which also
prevailed until recently, each mourner at a funeral carried in his
hand a sprig of rosemary, which he threw into the grave. The Pagan
practice of throwing a sprig of cypress into the grave has been
thought to symbolize the annihilation of the body, as these sprigs
would not grow if set in the earth: whereas the rosemary was to
signify the resurrection or up-springing of the body from the grave.
The existing custom of throwing flowers and immortelles into the grave
is derivable from the ancient practice. But the Welsh carry the
association of graves and floral life to the most lavish extreme, as
has already been pointed out. Shakspeare has alluded to this in
'Cymbeline,' the scene of which tragedy is principally in
Pembrokeshire, at and about Milford Haven:

              _Arv._ With fairest flowers,
    Whilst summer lasts, and I live here, Fidele,
    I'll sweeten thy sad grave: Thou shalt not lack
    The flower, that's like thy face, pale primrose; nor
    The azur'd harebell, like thy veins; no, nor
    The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,
    Outsweeten'd not thy breath.[157]
