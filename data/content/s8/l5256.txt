II.

Sometimes the spirit in animal form is the spirit of a mortal, doomed
to wear this shape for some offence. This again trenches on the
ground of magic; but the ascription to the spirit-world is distinct in
modern instances. There was a Rev. Mr. Hughes, a clergyman of the
Church of England, in the isle and county of Anglesea, who was
esteemed the most popular preacher thereabout in the last century, and
upon this account was envied by the rest of the clergy, 'which
occasioned his becoming a field preacher for a time, though he was
received into the Church again.'[69] As he was going one night to
preach, he came upon an artificial circle in the ground, between
Amlwch village and St. Elian Church, where a spirit in the shape of a
large greyhound jumped against him and threw him from his horse. This
experience was repeated on a second night. The third night he went on
foot, and warily; and now he saw that the spirit was chained. He drew
near, but keeping beyond the reach of the chain, and questioned the
spirit: 'Why troublest thou those that pass by?' The spirit replied
that its unrest was due to a silver groat it had hidden under a stone
when in the flesh, and which belonged to the church of St. Elian. The
clergyman being told where the groat was, found it and paid it over to
the church, and the chained spirit was released.
