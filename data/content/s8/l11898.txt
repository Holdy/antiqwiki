In a certain cavern in Glamorganshire, called the Ogof Cigfrain, or
Cavern of the Ravens, is said to be a chest of gold, watched over by
two birds of gloomy plumage, in a darkness so profound that nothing
can be seen but the fire of their sleepless eyes. To go there with
the purpose of disturbing them is to bring on a heaving and rolling of
the ground, accompanied by thunder and lightning. A swaggering drover
from Brecknockshire, though warned by a 'dark woman' that he had
better not try it, sneered that 'a couple of ravens were a fine matter
to be afraid of indeed!' and ventured into the cavern, with a long
rope about his waist, and a lantern in his hand. Some men who
accompanied him (seeing that he was bent on this rash and dangerous
emprise,) held the coil of rope, and paid it out as he went further
and further in. The result was prompt and simple: the sky cracked with
loud bursts of thunder and flashes of lightning, and the drover roared
with affright and rushed out of the dark cavern with his hair on end.
No coaxing ever prevailed on him to reveal the terrible sights he had
seen; when questioned he would only repeat in Welsh the advice of
'Punch' to those about to marry, viz., 'Peidiwch!'
