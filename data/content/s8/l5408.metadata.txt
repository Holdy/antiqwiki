summary: The Gwyllgi is a spectral creature associated with coastal areas, akin to the Mauthe Doog and the Shock, and its presence is considered ominous though not a direct death omen. Distinct from the Gwyllgi, the Cwn Annwn, or hellhounds, are confirmed omens of death, maintaining their mythological significance over time.
