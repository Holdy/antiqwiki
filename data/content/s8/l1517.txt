I.

The Gwragedd Annwn (literally, wives of the lower world, or hell) are
the elfin dames who dwell under the water. I find no resemblance in
the Welsh fairy to our familiar mermaid, beyond the watery abode, and
the sometimes winning ways. The Gwragedd Annwn are not fishy of
aspect, nor do they dwell in the sea. Their haunt is the lakes and
rivers, but especially the wild and lonely lakes upon the mountain
heights. These romantic sheets are surrounded with numberless
superstitions, which will be further treated of. In the realm of
faerie they serve as avenues of communication between this world and
the lower one of annwn, the shadowy domain presided over by Gwyn ap
Nudd, king of the fairies. This sub-aqueous realm is peopled by those
children of mystery termed Plant Annwn, and the belief is current
among the inhabitants of the Welsh mountains that the Gwragedd Annwn
still occasionally visit this upper world of ours.[23] The only
reference to Welsh mermaids I have either read or heard is contained
in Drayton's account of the Battle of Agincourt. There it is
mentioned, among the armorial ensigns of the counties of Wales:

    As Cardigan, the next to them that went,
    Came with a mermaid sitting on a rock.[24]
