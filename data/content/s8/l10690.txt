Only second in fame to Winifred's, among the Welsh themselves, is St.
Tecla's well, or Ffynon Tegla, in Denbighshire. It springs out of a
bog called Gwern Degla, about two hundred yards from the parish church
of Llandegla. Some account of the peculiar superstitious ceremony
connected with this well has already been given, in the chapter
treating of the sin-eater. It is there suggested that the cock to
which the fits are transferred by the patient at the well is a
substitute for the scapegoat of the Jews. The parish clerk of
Llandegla in 1855 said that an old man of his acquaintance 'remembered
quite well seeing the birds staggering about from the effects of the
fits' which had been transferred to them.
