VII.

This long and circumstantial account, which I have gathered from
different sources, but mainly from the two books of the Prophet Jones,
will impress the general reader with its resemblance, in many
respects, to modern newspaper ghost stories. The throwing about of
dishes, books, keys, etc.; its raps and touches of the person; its
making of loud noises by banging down metal objects; all these antics
are the tricks of contemporaneous spiritualism. But this spectre is of
a date when our spiritualism was quite unknown. The same is true of
the spirit which threw stones, another modern spiritualistic
accomplishment.[75] The spiritualists will argue from all this that
their belief is substantiated, not by any means that it is shaken. The
doubter will conclude that there were clever tricksters in humble
Welsh communities some time before the American city of Rochester had
produced its 'mediums.'

The student of comparative folk-lore, in reading these accounts,
will be equally impressed with their resemblance to phenomena noted
in many other lands. The conclusion is irresistible that we here
encounter but another form of the fairy which goes in Wales by the
name of the Bwbach, and in England is called the Hobgoblin, in
Denmark the Nis, in Scotland the Brownie. Also, the resemblance is
strong in all stories of this class to certain of the German Kobolds.
In several of these accounts of spirits in Wales appear the leading
particulars of the Kobold Hinzelmann, as condensed by Grimm from
Feldman's long narrative.[76] There is also a close correspondence to
certain ghost stories found in China. In the story of Woo, from the
'Che-wan-luk,'[77] appear details much like those in Hinzelmann, and
equally resembling Welsh particulars, either in the stories given
above, or those which follow. But we are now drawn so near to the
division of Familiar Spirits that we may as well enter it at once.
