A local legend of the origin of fairies in Anglesea mingles the
practical and the spiritual in this manner: 'In our Saviour's time
there lived a woman whose fortune it was to be possessed of nearly a
score of children, ... and as she saw our blessed Lord approach her
dwelling, being ashamed of being so prolific, and that He might not
see them all, she concealed about half of them closely, and after his
departure, when she went in search of them, to her great surprise
found they were all gone. They never afterwards could be discovered,
for it was supposed that as a punishment from heaven for hiding what
God had given her, she was deprived of them; and it is said these her
offspring have generated the race called fairies.'[62]
