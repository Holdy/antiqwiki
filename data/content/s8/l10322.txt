    Then up there raise ane wee wee man
      Franethe the moss-gray stane;
    His face was wan like the collifloure,
      For he nouthir had blude nor bane.

                          ... where he stood,

    From which fast trickled forth a silver flood,
    Full of great vertues, and for med'cine good: ...
    For unto life the dead it could restore.
                    SPENSER: _Faerie Queene_.
