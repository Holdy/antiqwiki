Among the Welsh peasantry the cromlechs are called by a variety of
names, one interesting group giving in Cardiganshire 'the Stone of the
Bitch,' in Glamorganshire 'the Stone of the Greyhound Bitch,' in
Carmarthenshire and in Monmouthshire 'the Kennel of the Greyhound
Bitch,' and in some other parts of Wales 'the Stone of the Wolf
Bitch.' These names refer to no fact of modern experience; they are
legendary. The Cambrian form of the story of Melusina is before us
here, with differing details. The wolf-bitch of the Welsh legend was a
princess who for her sins was transformed to that shape, and thus long
remained. Her name was Gast Rhymhi, and she had two cubs while a
wolf-bitch, with which she dwelt in a cave. After long suffering in
this wretched guise, she and her cubs were restored to their human
form 'for Arthur,' who sought her out. The unfortunate Melusina, it
will be remembered, was never entirely robbed of her human form.

    'Ange par la figure, et serpent par le reste,'

she was condemned by the lovely fay Pressina to become a serpent from
the waist downwards, on every Saturday, till she should meet a man who
would marry her under certain specified conditions. The monkish touch
is on the Welsh legend, in the medieval form in which we have it in
the Mabinogi of 'Kilhwch and Olwen.' The princess is transformed into
a wolf-bitch 'for her sins,' and when restored, although it is for
Arthur, 'God did change' her to a woman again.[182]
