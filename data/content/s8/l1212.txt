VI.

The most familiar form of the Pwca story is one which I have
encountered in several localities, varying so little in its details
that each account would be interchangeable with another by the
alteration of local names. This form presents a peasant who is
returning home from his work, or from a fair, when he sees a light
travelling before him. Looking closer he perceives that it is carried
by a dusky little figure, holding a lantern or candle at arm's length
over its head. He follows it for several miles, and suddenly finds
himself on the brink of a frightful precipice. From far down below
there rises to his ears the sound of a foaming torrent. At the same
moment the little goblin with the lantern springs across the chasm,
alighting on the opposite side; raises the light again high over its
head, utters a loud and malicious laugh, blows out its candle and
disappears up the opposite hill, leaving the awestruck peasant to get
home as best he can.
