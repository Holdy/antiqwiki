fighting. They had _been to a funeral_, had done the customary honours
by the remains of the departed brother or sister who had suffered,
died, and was "chested," and then, after drowning their grief in the
"cwrw," finished up in the police-court with a _finale_ involving the
payment of 5_s._ and costs, and 8_s._ 8_d._ damage, or in default
twenty-one days' hard labour.'--'Western Mail,' Jan. 31, 1877.
