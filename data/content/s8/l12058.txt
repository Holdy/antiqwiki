VIII.

For the prototype of the dragon-haunted caves and treasure-hills of
Wales, we must look to the lightning caverns of old Aryan fable, into
which no man might gaze and live, and which were in fact the attempted
explanation of thunderstorms, when the clouds appeared torn asunder by
the lightning.

Scholars have noted the impressive fact that the ancient Aryan people
had the same name for cloud and mountain; in the Old Norse, 'klakkr'
means both cloud and rock, and indeed the English word cloud has been
identified with the Anglo-Saxon 'clûd,' rock.[194] Equally significant
here is the fact that in the Welsh language 'draig' means both
lightning and dragon.

Primeval man, ignorant that the cloud was in any way different in
structure from the solid mountains whose peaks it emulated in
appearance, started back aghast and trembling when with crashing
thunders the celestial rocks opened, displaying for an instant the
glowing cavern whose splendour haunted his dreams. From this
phenomenon, whose goblins modern science has tamed and taught to run
errands along a wire, came a host of glittering legends, the shining
hammer of Thor, the lightning spear of Odin, the enchanted arrow of
Prince Ahmed, and the forked trident of Poseidon, as well as the
fire-darting dragons of our modern folk-lore.
