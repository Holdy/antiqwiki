IV.

The famous Pwca of the Trwyn Farm, in Mynyddyslwyn parish, came there
from his first abode, at Pantygasseg, in a jug of barm. One of the
farm-servants brought the jug to Pantygasseg, and as she was being
served with the barm in the jug, the Pwca was heard to say, 'The Pwca
is going away now in this jug of barm, and he'll never come back;' and
he was never heard at Pantygasseg again. Another story tells that a
servant let fall a ball of yarn, over the ledge of the hill whose base
is washed by the two fishponds between Hafod-yr-Ynys and Pontypool,
and the Pwca said, 'I am going in this ball, and I'll go to the Trwyn,
and never come back,'--and directly the ball was seen to roll down the
hillside, and across the valley, ascending the hill on the other side,
and trundling along briskly across the mountain top to its new abode.
