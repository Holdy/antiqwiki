The Gwyllgi finds its counterpart in the Mauthe Doog of the Isle of
Man and the Shock of the Norfolk coast. It there comes up out of the
sea and travels about in the lanes at night. To meet it is a sign of
trouble and death. The Gwyllgi also is confined to sea-coast parishes
mainly, and although not classed among death-omens, to look on it is
deemed dangerous. The hunting dogs, Cwn Annwn, or dogs of hell, whose
habitat is the sky overhead, have also other attributes which
distinguish them clearly from the Gwyllgi. They are death-omens,
ancient of lineage and still encountered. The Gwyllgi, while
suggesting some interesting comparisons with the old mythology,
appears to have lost vogue since smuggling ceased to be profitable.
