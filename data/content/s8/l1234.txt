VII.

Under the general title of Coblynau I class the fairies which haunt
the mines, quarries and underground regions of Wales, corresponding to
the cabalistic Gnomes. The word coblyn has the double meaning of
knocker or thumper and sprite or fiend; and may it not be the original
of goblin? It is applied by Welsh miners to pigmy fairies which dwell
in the mines, and point out, by a peculiar knocking or rapping, rich
veins of ore. The faith is extended, in some parts, so as to cover the
indication of subterranean treasures generally, in caves and secret
places of the mountains. The coblynau are described as being about
half a yard in height and very ugly to look upon, but extremely
good-natured, and warm friends of the miner. Their dress is a
grotesque imitation of the miner's garb, and they carry tiny hammers,
picks and lamps. They work busily, loading ore in buckets, flitting
about the shafts, turning tiny windlasses, and pounding away like
madmen, but really accomplishing nothing whatever. They have been
known to throw stones at the miners, when enraged at being lightly
spoken of; but the stones are harmless. Nevertheless, all miners of a
proper spirit refrain from provoking them, because their presence
brings good luck.
