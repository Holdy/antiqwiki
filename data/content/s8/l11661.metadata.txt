summary: The Welsh legend tells of Gast Rhymhi, a princess transformed into a wolf-bitch as punishment for her sins, living in a cave with her two cubs until restored to human form by King Arthur. This tale resembles the story of Melusina, where a woman is cursed with a serpentine form and must find a man to marry under special conditions to break the enchantment.
