A Carmarthenshire tradition names among those who lived for a period
among the Tylwyth Teg no less a person than the translator into Welsh
of Bunyan's 'Pilgrim's Progress.' He was called Iago ap Dewi, and
lived in the parish of Llanllawddog, Carmarthenshire, in a cottage
situated in the wood of Llangwyly. He was absent from the
neighbourhood for a long period, and the universal belief among the
peasantry was that Iago 'got out of bed one night to gaze on the
starry sky, as he was accustomed (astrology being one of his favourite
studies), and whilst thus occupied the fairies (who were accustomed to
resort in a neighbouring wood), passing by, carried him away, and he
dwelt with them seven years. Upon his return he was questioned by many
as to where he had been, but always avoided giving them a reply.'
