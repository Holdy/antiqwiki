[191] Mr. Conway, in his erudite chapter on the Basilisk, appears to
think that the red colour of the Welsh dragon, in the legend of Merlin
and Vortigern, determines its moral character; that it illustrates the
evil principle in the struggle between right and wrong, or light and
darkness, as black does in the Persian legends of fighting
serpents.--'Demonology and Devil-Lore,' p. 369. (London, Chatto and
Windus, 1879.)
