LLEDRITH--WRAITH.

Lledrith is an apparition or the spectre of a person seen soon before
his death or about the time he is dying.

A most remarkable tale of an apparition of this kind is given in "Ysten
Sioned," an interesting Welsh book written by the late Rev. Chancellor
D. Silvan Evans, and Mr. John Jones (Ivon).

About seventy years ago a young French sailor at Aberystwyth in
Cardiganshire, had fallen in love with a servant maid in that town,
and she with him. One evening, when this young woman was preparing
to go to bed she heard her lover calling to her by her name. It
was a bright moonlight night, and when she went to the door there
she saw the young man approaching and offering his hand to her;
but to her great surprise he disappeared again without speaking a
single word. Soon after this, news came to the town that a ship from
Aberystwyth got lost on the coast of Spain, and that amongst others
of the crew, who were drowned, was the young Frenchman. The young
woman discovered that her lover was drowned on the Spanish Coast in
the very same hour that she saw his apparition at Aberystwyth!

The young Earl of Lisburne ten years ago saw a wraith at Havod, on the
night his father was dying at Crosswood Park. Of this I was informed
by Mr. Inglis-Jones, Derry Ormond, and by his Lordship himself.

It is well-known that the great Lord Brougham saw an apparition of
this kind when a friend of his was dying in India, about one hundred
years ago.
