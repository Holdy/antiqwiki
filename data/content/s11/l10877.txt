ROBIN REDBREAST.

"Cursed is the man who kills a Robin," and ill-luck follows those
who take the eggs of this little bird.

The following Carmarthenshire story about the robin appeared in Bye
Gones, vol. 1. p. 173:--

"Far, far away, is a land of woe, darkness, spirits of evil, and
fire. Day by day does the little bird bear in its bill a drop of water
to quench the flame. So near to the burning stream does he fly that his
dear little feathers are scorched; and hence is he named Bronchuddyn
(Qu. Bronrhuddyn), i.e., breastburned, or breastscorched. To serve
little children, the robin dares approach the infernal pit. No good
child will hurt the devoted benefactor of man. The robin returns from
the land of fire, and, therefore, he feels the cold of winter far
more than the other birds. He shivers in brumal blasts, and hungry
he chirps before your door. Oh, my child, then, in pity throw a few
crumbs to the poor redbreast."

This old Welsh legend has been rendered into verse by the poet
Whittier.
