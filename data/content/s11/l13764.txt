THE PENTACLE.

Cadrawd, in the "Welsh Tit-Bits" column of the "Cardiff Times,"
speaking of South Pembrokeshire, says:--

The pentacle, or pentalpha--a figure consisting of five straight lines
so joined and intersected as to form a five-pointed star--is still
regarded in Fleming-land as a physical charm and the repository of
Talismanic power. This credulity is identical with the traditions of
the Greek Christians, who used the figure as a mystic sign in astrology
and necromancy. The figure was held in veneration by medi√¶valists,
and was known as the "Pentacle of Solomon." Sir William Jones, the
great Oriental scholar, in his work on "Folklore," observes that "it
is worthy of remark that at the present time the magical pentalpha
in the western window of the southern aisle of Westminster Abbey is
one of the emblems which still exist and speaks to the initiate that
the black monks who once chanted in the choir were deeply read in
occult science."

Some years ago, when on a tour in quest of lore, a Pembrokeshire
gentleman tells us that he remembers being puzzled by the appearance
of a number of pentacles being cut into the bark of several oak trees
near the solitary dwelling of a charmer. He addressed the Solon a few
questions on the meaning of these strange figures, but was cut short
with the reply, "They be signs." On Cresswell Hill, near Lady's Well,
there grows a row of tall beeches, on one of which may be seen the
figure of a pentacle. It stands about 15 feet from the ground, and
the wound was evidently made well nigh a century ago, judging by its
appearance. There is a tale that many years ago the "White Ladies"
were charmed away or banished from the vicinity of the Lady's Well,
of Cottage Dingle, by means of several pentacles being cut into the
bark of trees growing near by.
