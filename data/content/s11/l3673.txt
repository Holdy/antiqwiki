LENT.

There was an old custom once in Wales of taking an egg-shell, filled
with water, little meat, flour, etc., to a house of a neighbour,
and leave it on the outside of the window while all the family were
having their supper, and then run away, for if they were caught in
doing it, they were obliged to clean old shoes as a punishment. The
egg-shell used on the occasion was called "Crochan Grawys" (Lent
Cauldron). Some old people remember this in Carmarthenshire.
