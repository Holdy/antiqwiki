summary: In August 1862, David Evans and Evan Lewis witnessed a mysterious group they initially mistook for reapers, climbing a hillside near Maestwynog and engaging in an unusual dance that defied explanation, leading to their eventual disappearance into the ground. Their encounter was later suggested by a local to be with the traditional Fairies or Tylwyth Teg, continuing the folklore of Fairy sightings in various parts of Wales.
