CHAPTER V.

THE FAIRIES (TYLWYTH TEG).


                       "In olde dayes of King Artour,
                        Of which the Bretons speken gret honour,
                        All was this lond fulfilled of Faerie;
                        The elf-quene with hire joly compagnie
                        Danced ful oft in many a grene mede.
                        This was the old opinion as I rede,
                        I speke of many hundred yeres ago;
                        But now can no man see non elves mo."

                                                              --Chaucer.


A book dealing with Superstitions and popular beliefs would be
incomplete without assigning a prominent place to the Fairies, or
"Tylwyth Teg," as they are called in Welsh. It is true that in Wales,
as in other places, the Fairies have become things of the past;
but even in the present day many old people, and perhaps others,
still believe that such beings did once exist, and that the reason
why they are not now to be seen is that they have been exorcised.

Many of the Welsh Fairy Tales date from remote antiquity and are, in
common with like legends of other countries, relics of the ancient
mythology, in which the natural and the supernatural are blended
together.
