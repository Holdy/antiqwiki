THE MILK-WHITE MILCH COW.

The milk-white Milch Cow gave enough of milk to every one who desired
it; and however frequently milked, or by whatever number of persons,
she was never found deficient. All persons who drank of her milk,
were healed of every illness; from being fools they became wise, and
from being wicked, became happy. The cow went round the world; and
wherever she appeared, she filled with milk all the vessels that could
be found; leaving calves behind her for all the wise and happy. It was
from her that all the milch cows in the world were obtained. After
traversing the Island of Britain, for the benefit and blessing of
country and kindred, she reached the Vale of Towy; where, tempted by
fine appearance and superior condition, the natives sought to kill and
eat her; but just as they were proceeding to effect their purpose,
she vanished from between their hands, and was never seen again. A
house still remains in the locality, called Y Fuwch Laethwen-Lefrith,
(the Milk-white Milch Cow).--Iolo M.S.S., page 475.

There is a version of this well-known legend of the mythic cow,
located near Aberdovey. According to the Aberdovey tale, the cow
was of Fairy origin, and disappeared into Barfog Lake when a farmer
attempted to slaughter the animal.
