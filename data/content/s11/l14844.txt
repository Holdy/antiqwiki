PENCARREG LAKE.

Pencarreg Lake is not far from Lampeter, but lies on
the Carmarthenshire side of the river Teivy, and near
Llanybyther. According to an old tradition in the district, a village
once stood on the spot where now the lake is; but the village was
swallowed up, and the lake is now known as the "bottomless."
