THE WEDDING DAY.

At the present time, Welsh people marry on any day of the week, but
about fifty years ago Wednesday was a favourite day in some places,
and Friday in other places. I am writing more especially, of course,
of West Wales. Indeed, in some parishes old men informed me that when
they were young they did not remember any one marrying, except on a
Friday. This fact, undoubtedly, is likely to surprise many English
readers, who regard Friday as an unlucky day for anything.

Meyrick, writing about one hundred years ago in his History of
Cardiganshire, says Saturday was the Wedding Day, and other writers
mention the same thing, and it is evident that Saturday was the day
on which most people did marry, except in a few districts, about three
generations ago, as well as in older times. Whether this day, that is,
Saturday, was commonly fixed upon from a belief that it was a lucky day
for marriage, or from the convenience of Sunday intervening between it
and a working day, is rather difficult to know, but it seems that the
following old English Marrying Rhyme was either unknown to the Welsh,
or that they did not give heed to it:--


              To marry on

   "Monday wealth, Tuesday for health,
    Wednesday the best day of all;
    Thursday for crosses, Friday for losses,
    Saturday no luck at all!"
