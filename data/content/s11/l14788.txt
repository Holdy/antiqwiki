THE LLANLLAWER WELL.

A well near the Church of Llanllawer, in the neighbourhood of
Fishguard, had once the reputation of possessing medical properties,
and was much frequented in the old times.

There is a Rocking-Stone also in this neighbourhood, perhaps once
used in divination.

There was also a well near Moelgrove, between Nevern and Cardigan,
which was resorted to once, and pins were discovered at the bottom
of it.
