A GHOST APPEARING TO POINT OUT HIDDEN TREASURE IN RADNORSHIRE.

There is a story in Radnorshire, that a palace not far from the
neighbourhood of Abbey Cwm Hir, was once haunted by a Spirit, which
appeared in various forms and made such terrible noise that no one
cared to live in the house for a long time. At last, however, a young
gentleman who had newly married had the courage to face the ghost,
and discovered most valuable treasures which had been hidden in the
ground near the house. The spot where the gold had been buried was
pointed out to the young man by the Spirit, and the house was never
haunted after this.

It is a well-known fact that a Spirit revealed hidden treasure to a
Baptist Minister, who lived in a respectable old mansion somewhere
not far from Nevern in Pembrokeshire. I met with several persons at
Eglwyswrw and other places, who vouched for the truth of the fact. The
treasure had been hidden, so it is said, in the time of Cromwell.

Some of the ghosts who reveal hidden money are not always
generous. According to the Rev. Edmund Jones, the ghost of one Anne
Dewy, a woman who had hanged herself, compelled a young man in the
Vale of Towy, Carmarthenshire, to cast into the river a bag of money
which had been hid in the wall of a house. Instead of keeping the money
himself, the young man obeyed the ghost against his better judgment,
and the sum concerned was "Â£200 or more."
