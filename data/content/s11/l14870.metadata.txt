summary: A local tradition in Carmarthenshire tells of a small well with a stone cover on a hill near Gorslas that turned into the lake known as Llyn Llechwen due to a boy failing to replace the cover. An alternative version of the tale attributes the incident to a warrior named Owen Lawgoch and his men, who supposedly sleep in a cave waiting to be awakened by the sound of battle.
