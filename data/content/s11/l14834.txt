TREGARON LAKE.

There is a small lake near Tregaron, between Lampeter and Aberystwyth;
and there is a tradition in the neighbourhood that the village or
town of Tregaron was once situated on the spot which is now occupied
by the lake, but that it sunk, and some fancy they can see some ruins
or remains now at the bottom of the lake.
