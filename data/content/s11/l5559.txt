SON OF LLECH Y DERWYDD AND THE FAIRIES.

The writer of the following tale was the late Rev. Benjamin Williams
(Gwynionydd), an eminent antiquarian, Folk-Lorist, and a bard, and
it is to be found in Welsh in Y Brython, vol. III., page 460. It is
evident that the scene of the story was West or Mid-Wales. Mr. Williams
heard the tale from old people who believed in the truth of it:--

"Yr oedd mab Llech y Derwydd yn unig blentyn ei rieni, ac hefyd yn
etifedd y tyddyn. Yr oedd felly yn anwyl, ie, yn ddau lygad ei dad
a'i fam.

"Yr oedd y pen gwas a mab y ty yn gyfeillion mynwesol iawn, fel dau
frawd, ie, fel gyfeilliaid. Gan fod y mab a'r gwas y fath gyfeillion,
byddai gwraig y ty bob amser yn darpar dillad i'r gwas yr un peth yn
hollol ag i'r mab. Cwympodd y ddau gyfaill mewn serch a dwy ddynes
ieuainc, brydferth, ac uchel eu parch yn yr ardal, a mawr oedd y
boddineb yn Llech y Derwydd; ac yn fuan ymunodd y ddau bar mewn
glan briodas, a mawr fu y rhialtwch ar yr amser. Cafodd y gwas le
cyfleus i fyw ar dir Llech y Derwydd. Yn mhen tua haner blwyddyn ar
ol priodi o'r mab, aeth ei gyfaill ac yntau allan i hela; enciliodd
y deiliad i ryw gilfach lawn o anialwch, i edrych am helwriaeth; a
dychwelodd yn y man at ei gyfaill, ond erbyn dyfod yno, nid oedd modd
gweled y mab yn un man. Parhaodd i edrych o gwmpas am dro gan waeddi
a chwibanu, ond dim un arwydd am ei gyfaill. Yn mhen tro aeth adref
i Llech y Derwydd, gan ddysgwyl ei weled yno; ond ni wyddai neb ddim
am dano. Mawr oedd y gofid yn y teulu drwy y nos; ac erbyn dranoeth
yr oedd eu pryder yn llawer mwy. Aethpwyd i weled y fan lle y gwelodd
ei gyfaill ef olaf. Wylai ei fam a'i wraig am y gwaethaf. Yr oedd y
tad dipyn yn well na'i wraig a'i fam, ond edrychai yntau fel yn haner
gwallgof. Edrychwyd ar y fan olaf y gwelodd y deiliad ef, ac er eu
mawr syndod a'u gofid, canfyddasent gylch y Tylwyth Teg gerllaw y fan,
a chofiodd y deiliad yn y man iddo glywed swn peroriaeth hudoliaethus
iawn rywle ar y pryd. Penderfynwyd ar unwaith iddo fod mor anffodus
a myned i gylch y Tylwyth, a chael ei gludo ymaith na wyddid i ba le.

"Aeth wythnosau a misoedd gofidus heibio, a ganwyd mab i fab Llech
y Derwydd; ond nid oedd y tad ieuanc yno i gael gweled ei blentyn,
ac yr oedd hyny yn ofidus iawn gan yr hen bobl. Beth bynag, daeth y
dyn bach i fyny yr un ddelw a'i dad, fel pe buasai wedi ei arlunio; a
mawr ydoedd yng ngolwg ei daid a'i nain. Efe oedd pobpeth yno. Tyfodd
i oedran gwr, a phriododd a merch landeg yn y gymydogaeth; ond nid
oedd gair da i'r tylwyth eu bod yn bobl hawddgar.

"Bu farw yr hen bobl, a bu farw y ferch-yng-nghyfraith hefyd. Ar
ryw brydnawn gwyntog, ym mis Hydref, gwelai teulu Llech y Derwydd
henafgwr tal, teneu, a'i farf a'i wallt fel yr eira, yr hwn a dybient
ydoedd Iddew, yn dynesu yn araf araf at y ty. Hylldremiai y morwynion
drwy y ffenestr, a chwarddai y feistress am ben yr 'hen Iddew,' gan
godi y plant un ar ol y llall i'w weled yn dyfod. Daeth at y drws,
a daeth i mewn hefyd yn lled eofn, gan ofyn am ei rieni. Atebai
y wraig ef yn daeog, a choeglyd anghyffredin, gan ddywedyd, 'Beth
oedd yr hen Iddew meddw yn dyfod yno,' oblegid tybient ei fod wedi
yfed, onid e ni fuasai yn siarad felly. Edrychai yr hen wr yn syn a
phryderus iawn ar bob peth yn y ty, gan synu llawer; ond ar y plant
bychain ar hyd y llawr y sylwai fwyaf. Edrychai yn llawn siomedigaeth
a gofid. Dywedodd yr hanes i gyd, iddo fod allan yn hela ddoe, a'i fod
yn awr yn dychwelyd. Dywedodd y wraig iddi glywed chwedl am dad ei gwr
flynyddau cyn ei geni, ei fod wedi myned ar goll wrth hela; ond fod
ei thad yn dywedyd wrthi nad gwir hyny, mai ei ladd a gafodd. Aeth y
wraig yn anystywallt, ac yn llwyr o'i chof eisiau fod yr hen 'Iddew' yn
myned allan. Cyffrodd yr hen wr, a dywedai mai efe ydoedd perchen y ty,
ac y byddai raid iddo gael ei hawl. Aeth allan i weled ei feddianau,
ac yn fuan i dy y deiliad. Er ei syndod, yr oedd pethau wedi newid
yn fawr yno. Ar ol ymddiddan am dro a hen wr oedranus wrth y tan,
edrychai y naill fwy fwy ar y llall. Dywedai yr hen wr beth fu tynged
ei ben gyfaill, mab Llech y Derwydd. Siaradent yn bwyllog am bethau
mebyd, ond yr oedd y cyfan fel breuddwyd. Beth bynag, penderfynodd
yr hen wr yn y cornel mai ei hen gyfaill, mab Llech y Derwydd,
oedd yr ymwelydd, wedi dychwelyd o wlad y Tylwyth Teg, ar ol bod
yno haner can' mlynedd. Credodd yr hen wr a'r farf wen ei dynged,
a mawr y siarad a'r holi fu gan y naill y llall am oriau lawer.

"Dywedai fod gwr Llech y Derwydd y diwrnod hwnw oddi cartref. Cafwyd
gan yr hen ymwelydd fwyta bwyd; ond er mawr fraw, syrthiodd y bwytawr
yn farw yn y fan. Nid oes hanes fod trengholiad wedi bod ar y corff;
ond dywedai y chwedl mae yr achos oedd, iddo fwyta bwyd ar ol bod yn
myd y Tylwyth Teg cyhyd. Mynodd ei hen gyfaill weled ei gladdu yn ochr
ei deidiau. Bu melldith fyth, hyd y silcyn ach, yn Llech y Derwydd,
o blegid sarugrwydd y wraig i'w thad-yng-nghyfraith, nes gwerthu y
lle naw gwaith."


The above tale translated into English reads as follows:--

"The son of Llech y Derwydd was the only child of his parents, and
also the heir to the farm. He was, therefore, very dear to his father
and mother, yea, he was as the very light of their eyes. The son and
the head servant man were more than bosom friends, they were like two
brothers, or rather twins. As the son and the servant were such close
friends, the farmer's wife was in the habit of clothing them exactly
alike. The two friends fell in love with two young handsome women who
were highly respected in the neighbourhood. This event gave the old
people great satisfaction, and ere long the two couples were joined
in holy wedlock, and great was the merry-making on the occasion. The
servant man obtained a convenient place to live in on the grounds of
Llech y Derwydd.

"About six months after the marriage of the son, he and the servant
man went out to hunt. The servant penetrated to a ravine filled with
brushwood to look for game, and presently returned to his friend, but
by the time he came back the son was nowhere to be seen. He continued
awhile looking about for his absent friend, shouting and whistling
to attract his attention, but there was no answer to his calls. By
and by he went home to Llech y Derwydd, expecting to find him there,
but no one knew anything about him. Great was the grief of the family
throughout the night, but it was even greater next day. They went to
inspect the place where the son had last been seen. His mother and his
wife wept bitterly, but the father had greater control over himself,
still he appeared as half mad. They inspected the place where the
servant man had last seen his friend, and, to their great surprise
and sorrow, observed a Fairy ring close by the spot, and the servant
recollected that he had heard seductive music somewhere about the
time that he parted with his friend.

"They came to the conclusion at once that the man had been so
unfortunate as to enter the Fairy ring, and they conjectured that he
had been transported no one knew where. Weary weeks and months passed
away, and a son was born to the absent man.

"The little one grew up the very image of his father, and very
precious was he to his grandfather and grandmother. In fact, he was
everything to them. He grew up to man's estate and married a pretty
girl in the neighbourhood, but her people had not the reputation of
being kind-hearted. The old folks died, and also their daughter-in-law.

"One windy afternoon in the month of October, the family of Llech y
Derwydd saw a tall thin old man with beard and hair as white as snow,
who they thought was a Jew approaching slowly, very slowly, towards
the house. The servant girls stared mockingly through the window
at him, and their mistress laughed unfeelingly at the 'old Jew,'
and lifted the children up, one after the other, to get a sight of
him as he neared the house.

"He came to the door, and entered the house boldly enough, and
inquired after his parents. The mistress answered him in a surly and
unusually contemptuous manner and wished to know 'What the drunken
old Jew wanted there,' for they thought he must have been drinking
or he would never have spoken in the way he did. The old man looked
at everything in the house with surprise and bewilderment, but the
little children about the floor took his attention more than anything
else. His looks betrayed sorrow and deep disappointment. He related
his whole history, that yesterday he had gone out to hunt, and that
now he had returned. The mistress told him that she had heard a story
about her husband's father, which occurred before she was born, that
he had been lost whilst hunting, but that her father had told her that
the story was not true, but that he had been killed. The woman became
uneasy and angry that the old 'Jew' did not depart. The old man was
roused, and said that the house was his, and that he would have his
rights. He went to inspect his possessions, and shortly afterwards
directed his steps to the servant's house. To his surprise he saw that
things were greatly changed. After conversing awhile with an aged man
who sat by the fire, they carefully looked each other in the face,
and the old man by the fire related the sad history of his lost friend,
the son of Llech y Derwydd.

"They conversed together deliberately on the events of their youth,
but all seemed like a dream. However, the old man in the corner came to
the conclusion that his visitor was his old friend, the son of Llech y
Derwydd, returned from the land of the Fairies, after spending there
fifty years.

"The old man with the white beard believed the story related by his
friend, and long was the talk and many were the questions which the one
gave to the other. The visitor was informed that the master of Llech y
Derwydd was from home that day, and he was persuaded to eat some food;
but to the horror of all, when he had done so, he instantly fell down
dead. We are not informed that an inquest was held over the body; but
the tale relates that the cause of the man's sudden death was that he
ate food after having been so long in the land of the Fairies. His old
friend insisted on the dead man being buried with his ancestors. The
rudeness of the mistress of Llech y Derwydd to her father-in-law
brought a curse upon the place and family, 'hyd y silcyn ach,' and
her offence was not expiated until the farm had been sold nine times."
