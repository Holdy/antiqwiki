summary: Captain Alldridge recounted his experiences aboard the H.M.S. "Asp," describing continuous, mysterious noises and sightings of a ghostly lady pointing to Heaven, leading to a dwindling crew due to fear. Believing the ship to be haunted by the spirit of a woman found dead with her throat cut years earlier, the ghostly occurrences ceased after the ship was docked for repairs at Pembroke Dockyard, ending the supernatural visits.
