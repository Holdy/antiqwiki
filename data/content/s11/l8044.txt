THE SPIRIT OF A DEAD DAUGHTER APPEARING TO THE MOTHER.

About ninety years ago one Mrs. D. Thomas, Llanfair, Llandyssul,
had a daughter who was very promising, and her mother was so fond
of her. She was sent to the well-known school of the celebrated
Mr. Davis of Castell Howell. Unfortunately, however, the girl died,
to the great sorrow of her poor mother who bewailed her loss day and
night. But one day when the old lady was out in the potato field,
the spirit of her dead daughter appeared suddenly to her, and spoke to
her mother with severe looks: "Don't cry after me, for I am in a much
better place." The above account I heard from the lips of Mr. Rees,
Maesymeillion, parish of Llandyssul, about three years ago, to whom
and his brother I am indebted for several other stories.
