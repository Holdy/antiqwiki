FAIRY GLOVES.

Mrs. A. Crawley-Boevey, of Birchgrove, Crosswood, a lady who is
greatly interested in Folk-Lore, informed me that it is believed in
Gloucestershire that the Fairies live in Fox Gloves. I have not so
far discovered this belief in Wales, but Fox Glove is called in some
part of the Principality Menyg y Tylwyth Teg (Fairy Gloves). Also
Menyg Ellyllon (Elves Gloves).
