OGOF MORRIS (MORRIS'S CAVE).

Near Tre'rddol in North Cardiganshire, there is a cave known as Ogof
Morris. According to a tradition I heard in the neighbourhood, this
Morris was a notorious robber who lived in this cave, and went about
to steal hens and sheep; but at last he was caught and hanged at
Cardigan. According to the eminent antiquarian, Mr. Barnwell, there
was a robber of the name also in Pembrokeshire, who had a little dog
trained to fetch the arrows shot at unfortunate wayfarers. At last he
was killed and buried at a spot where there is a stone still called
"Bedd Morris" on the highway from St. David's to Newport.
