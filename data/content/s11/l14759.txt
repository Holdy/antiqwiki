ST. EDREN'S WELL.

St. Edren's is situated about half way between Haverfordwest and
Fishguard. According to a local tradition there was once a most
famous sacred well in the Churchyard, much resorted to for the cure
of many complaints, especially hydrophobia; but one time, a woman
washed her clothes in this well on Sunday, which caused the spring
to dry up as a curse for breaking the Sabbath. Fortunately, however,
for poor patients, the healing propensities or virtues of its water
were miraculously transferred into the churchyard grass. So people
took some of the grass to their homes to eat it with their food,
which cured them of their ailments. There was a hole in the church
wall to receive the offerings of those who came to procure some of
this grass. One old man informed the Vicar, the Rev. J. Bowen, who
is an enthusiastic antiquarian, that the sacred well had been closed
in order to drain the graveyard, but that there is still a spring in
a field outside the wall.
