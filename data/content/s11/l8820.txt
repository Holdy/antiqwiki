A GHOST SEEN IN THE FORM OF A CALF IN CARDIGANSHIRE.

Rhosygarth, between Llanilar and Lledrod, was a well-known haunted spot
in former times. This demon often appeared on the road to travellers
late at night in the form of a calf, but with a head much like that
of a dog. Many years ago, Mr. Hughes, of Pantyddafad, was going
home one night on horseback; but just as he was passing Rhosygarth,
the ghost appeared, and passed across the road right in front of the
horse. My informant, Thomas Jones, Pontrhydfendigaid, was a servant at
Pantyddafad, heard the old gentleman often speaking about the ghost he
had seen at Rhosygarth, and that Mr. Hughes was great-grand-father to
Dr. Hughes, of Cwitycadno, Llanilar. Mr. Jones also added that he knew
a young man who always laughed when people talked about seeing ghosts;
but one night, a man (as he at first thought), followed him for about
a mile, and after coming close to him, vanished into nothing. The
young man nearly fainted, and after this never doubted the reality
of the world of spirits.
