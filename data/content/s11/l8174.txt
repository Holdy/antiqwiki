HAUNTED MANSIONS OF LLANELLY, CARMARTHENSHIRE.

Mr. Innes, in "Old Llanelly," page 145, says:--

"The ghost of Lady Mansel 'walked' and haunted Old Stradey House,"
and "Llanelly House probably had had ghosts for it is certain that
spirits may be found there even now; and an old man has recently
made a statement that when a boy he slept in the Stepney Mansion;
but as he ascended to his room he heard the rustling brocade of a
lady's dress in an apparently empty corridor.

"This lady during the night played upon an organ built up in one of
the thick walls."
