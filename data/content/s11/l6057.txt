A LLANRHYSTYD MAID LOST AMONG THE FAIRIES.

Mr David Morgan, Carpenter, Llanrhystyd, informed me that some years
ago the maid servant of Pencareg Farm in the neighbourhood, went out
one evening to bring home the cattle which were grazing some distance
away from the house. A boy employed to look after the cattle in the
day-time known as "bugail bach," saw the Fairies dragging the maid into
their circle or ring, where she joined them in their dances. Search
was made for her everywhere, but she was never seen again.
