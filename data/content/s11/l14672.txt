THE PWLLFFEIN WELL.

Mr. Rees, Maesymeillion, Llandyssul, Cardiganshire, informed me,
that there was once a famous well for its healing virtues, on the
side of the river Clettwr, known as "Ffynon Pwllffein." An old man
who is now dead, informed him that this well was much resorted to
about the first part of the last century, and pins were once found
at its bottom. The well has been destroyed by the river now.

Ffynon-Ddewi, or St. David's Well, near Alltyrodyn, in the same
parish, was also much resorted to once, even within living memory,
as it was popularly esteemed for its cures of whooping-cough.
