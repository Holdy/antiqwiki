ST. MARY'S WELL, RHAYADER.

In the "History of Radnorshire" it is stated: "On the western extremity
of the common called Maes-y-dref, is a most excellent spring of pure
and limpid water, namely, St. Mary's Well. It was heretofore a custom
for the young people of Rhayader, of both sexes, to resort hither on
Sunday evenings, during the Spring and Summer seasons, to drink this
salutary beverage sweetened with sugar."
