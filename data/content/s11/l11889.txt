A WITCH IN THE FORM OF A HARE HUNTED IN CARDIGANSHIRE.

Mr. Rees, Maesymeillion, Llandyssul, told me the following tale which
he had heard from an old woman in the neighbourhood:--

Once there was a Major Brooks living in the parish of Llanarth, who
kept hounds and was fond of hunting. One day, he was hunting a hare
that a little boy of nine years old had started; but the hare not only
managed to elude her pursuers, but even to turn back and attack the
hounds. The hunting of this hare was attempted day after day, but with
the same results; and the general opinion in the neighbourhood was,
that this hare was nothing but an old witch who lived in that part,
with whom the huntsman had quarrelled.

An old man in Carmarthenshire informed me that an old woman known as
Peggy Abercamles, and her brother Will, in the neighbourhood of Cilcwm,
in that county were seen running about at night in the form of hares.
