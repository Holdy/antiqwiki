ELIAS, FORCH Y CWM AND THE FAIRIES.

Elias, Forch y Cwm, who was a servant man in the same neighbourhood,
was one day ploughing on the field, but when he happened to look about
he perceived the Fairies on Bank-Cwmpridd, and coming towards him. The
man ran home in terror from the field, and this was in broad daylight.

The late Mr. T. Compton Davies, Aberayron, an eminent Folk-Lorist,
related to me the following two stories, and informed me that he
had already written them in Welsh for "Cymru," in which excellent
periodical they appeared, September, 1892, page 117.
