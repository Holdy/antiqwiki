HOLY BREAD AS A REMEDY.

"Black or Holy Bread is that which has been made on Good Friday and
kept for twelve months. It is stored in the cottage-roof where it
keeps dry and becomes black, and is consumed on Good Friday only. This
bread is here said to be an excellent remedy for people and cattle
suffering from certain complaints."--The Church Plate of Radnorshire
by the Rev. J. T. Evans, page 15.



HOW TO CURE A "FOUL FOOT."

"If a hoofed animal is found to be suffering from "Foul Foot" it must
be taken to a field, or sward, and the impression made on the ground
by one of its hoofs must be carefully cut out and placed upside down
on a hedge or bush; when the turf has withered the animal will be
cured."--Church Plate of Radnorshire, page 16.
