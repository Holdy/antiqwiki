HOW TO CURE A DOG THAT HAS BEEN BITTEN BY A MAD DOG.

Write down on a bit of paper the words "Arare, cnarare, phragnare,"
in three lines as follows:


    Arare Charare Phragnare.
    Phragnare Cnarare arare
    Arare cnarare phragnare.


Also write down in addition the name of the dog.

Having done this, put the paper in a piece of bread and give to the
dog to eat. About the middle of the last century, when mad dogs were
common, this "prescription" was considered "a sure and certain cure";
or at least, so says my informant, an old farmer in the neighbourhood
of Ystrad Meurig, who also added that the mountain farmers obtained
this charm from Dr. Harries, the wizard of Cwrtycadno.
