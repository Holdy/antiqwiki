THROWING THE BAR.

"Cryfder dan bwysau," or displaying strength in hurling a stone,
or throwing a bar, which was one of the ancient Welsh games.

Meyrick, in his "History of Cardiganshire," writing one hundred years
ago, says that casting of the bar was still continued in his time,
particularly in Cardiganshire, "where the people have a meeting
once a year at certain Chapels, Yspytty Ystwith, Yspytty Cenvyn,
etc., for this purpose. They remain in the Chapel all night to try
their activity in wrestling, all the benches being removed, and the
spectators, different from ancient regulations, are generally young
women, and old champions, who are to see fair play."
