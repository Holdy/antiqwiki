THE CAT.

In some parts of the country a black cat is looked upon with extreme
disfavour; in other parts again people say that a black cat keeps
trouble out of the house. "Cath ddu yn cadw gofid ma's o'r ty."

It was thought that cats born in May bring snakes into the house.

If the cat washed her face, strangers might be expected.
