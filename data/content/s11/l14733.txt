ST. NON'S WELL, NEAR ST. DAVID'S.

This famous holy well, dedicated to Non, the mother of St. David,
Patron Saint of Wales, is situated near the remains of St. Non's
Chapel, near St. David's, and was formerly much resorted to for
many complaints; and Fenton in his History of Pembrokeshire says:
"In my infancy, as was the general usage with respect to children at
that time, I was often dipped in it, and offerings, however trifling,
even of a farthing or a pin, were made after each ablution, and the
bottom of the well shone with votive brass.... At the upper end of the
field leading to Non's Chapel there appears the ruined site of a house,
probably inhabited by the person deputed to take care of the spring,
most likely a lucrative employment in more superstitious times."

When I visited the neighbourhood a few years ago, an old man at
St. David's informed me that he remembered diseased persons coming
to the well, and returning home completely restored to good health,
and that without doubt there must be healing virtues in the water
of this sacred spring. The old man also believed that St. David was
baptised in the well. Pembrokeshire people firmly believe that the
Patron Saint of Wales was born in the neighbourhood which bears his
name. The Welsh name for the cathedral and the town of St. David's
is Ty Ddewi, which means the House of David.
