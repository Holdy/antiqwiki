summary: A superstition suggests that if a sick person craves pigeon, it is an omen of imminent death, and it's also believed that people cannot die peacefully if their pillows contain pigeon's feathers. In 1803, a woman in Pembrokeshire experienced this superstition when her nurse removed the pillow from beneath her head on her deathbed.
