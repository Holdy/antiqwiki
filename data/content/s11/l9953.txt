A LLANGATHEN TALE.

The following appeared in "Apparitions in Wales" by Rev. Edmund Jones,
and it is a story of long ago:

"Some years ago one Jane Wyat, my wife's sister, being nurse to Baronet
Rudd's three children, and his Lady being dead, his house-keeper
going late into a chamber where the maid servants lay, saw five of
these lights together: while after that chamber being newly plastered,
a great grate of coal fire was kindled therein to hasten the drying
of it. At night five of the maid servants went there to bed as these
were wont, and in the morning were all found dead, and suffocated
with the steam of the new tempered lime and coal."

This was at Llangathen, in Carmarthenshire.
