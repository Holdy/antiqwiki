EURGLAWDD.

In a field called Llettyngharad on this farm, which is in the parish
of Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn, there are two stones respecting which
an ancient prophecy says that when the third appears, the end of the
world will be at hand. At Llwynglas, in the same parish, there was once
preserved a long knife, which, according to tradition, was used by the
Saxons in the time of Vortigern, at the treachery of the long knives.



TRAETH SAITH (CARDIGANSHIRE).

Tradition says that Traeth Saith--the Seven's Shore--had its name from
the seven daughters of a king who were wrecked there, having been put
by order of their father into a vessel without sails or oars. A poem
commemorates this tradition.

Probably the place is named from a brook.
