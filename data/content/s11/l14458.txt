THE PRIEST'S WELL.

"There is a well on the Picton Castle Estate, situated near the Red
House Cottages, called the Priest's Well, which the children are
(this was written thirty-five years ago) in the habit of decorating
with mountain ash (or as it is called "Cayer" in the district) and
cowslips on May Day. This is supposed to have the effect of keeping
the witches away from those families who get water from the well during
the year. The children sing over the well while decorating it "Cayer,
Cayer, keep the witches in May Fair."--Bye-Gones, December, 1874.
