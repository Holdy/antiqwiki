A WITCH WHO APPEARED IN THE FORM OF AN HARE EVERY MORNING TO A SERVANT
MAID AT MILKING TIME.

Griffiths informed me that when his mother was young, she was engaged
as a servant maid at a small gentleman's seat, called Pontfaen, in the
Vale of Gwaun. But whenever she went out early in the morning to milk
the cows, an old witch who lived in the neighbourhood always made her
appearance in the form of an hare, annoying the girl very much. At
last she informed her master of it, and at once the gentleman took
his gun and shot the hare; but somehow, the animal escaped, though
he succeeded in wounding and drawing blood from her. After this, the
young woman went to see the old hag who was supposed to be a witch,
Maggie by name, and found her in bed with a sore leg.
