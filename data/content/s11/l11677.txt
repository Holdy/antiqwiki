A FISHGUARD WITCH DISCOMFITED.

Another way of protecting oneself from witchcraft was to keep a nail
on the floor under the foot when a witch came to the door. Mr. David
Rees, baker at Fishguard, told me a few years ago that there was
once a particular witch in that town who was very troublesome, as
she was always begging, and that people always gave to her, as they
were afraid of offending her. She often came to beg from his mother,
who at last, as advised by her friends, procured a big nail from
a blacksmith's shop. She put the nail under her foot on the floor,
the next time the old witch came to the door begging. The old hag
came again as usual to beg and to threaten; but my informant's mother
sent her away empty handed, saying, "Go away from my door old woman,
I am not afraid of you now, for I have my foot on a nail." She kept
her foot on the nail till the witch went out of sight, and by doing
so felt herself safe from the old hag's spells.

Nails or a horseshoe or an old iron were considered preservatives
against witchcraft.
