TANWEDD.

Another death portent was the "tanwedd," so called because it
appeared as a fiery light. The Rev. Edmund Jones says in his
"Apparitions".--"When it falls to the ground it sparkleth and
lightens. The freeholders and landlords upon whose ground it falls,
will certainly die in a short time after."
