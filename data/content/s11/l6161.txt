NANCY TYNLLAIN AND HER SON SEEING FAIRIES ON HORSES.

A man named Timothy in the parish of Llanarth, Cardiganshire, told
me that an old woman known as Nancy Tynllain and her son, Shenkin
Phillips, had seen the Tylwyth Teg (fairies) on one occasion. Nancy
died over sixty years ago. She and her son one day left home rather
early in the morning, as they were going to Cynon's Fair, and had some
distance to go. As they proceeded on their horses in the direction
of Wilgarn, they saw the Fairies, mounted on small horses, galloping
round and round as in a circle round about a certain hillock, and
Nancy took particular notice that one of the Fairy women had a red
cloak on. As the old woman and her son were looking on, watching
the movements of the Fairies, Nancy remarked, "That Fairy woman over
there rides very much like myself." This was at early dawn.
