summary: A gwiber, or Flying Serpent, appeared in Newcastle Emlyn, alighting on the castle and terrifying townsfolk during a fair day in the eighteenth century. A brave soldier successfully wounded the serpent by shooting at its unarmored navel from the river, leading to the creature's death and the staining of the river with its blood.
