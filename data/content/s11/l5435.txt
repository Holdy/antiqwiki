THE SERVANT GIRL WHO WAS LOST IN THE FAIRY CIRCLE.

The following is another of the tales recorded in "Ystraeon y Gwyll,"
by the late D. Lledrod Davies:--

"There lived in an old farm house on the banks of the Teivy, a
respectable family, and in order to carry on the work of the farm
successfully, they kept men servants and maid servants.

One afternoon, a servant-man and a servant girl went out to look
for the cows, but as they were both crossing a marshy flat, the man
suddenly missed the girl, and after much shouting and searching,
no sound of her voice could be heard replying. He then took home
the cows, and informed the family of the mysterious disappearance of
the servant maid which took place so suddenly. As the Fairies were
suspected, it was resolved to go to the dyn hysbys (wise man).

To him they went, and he informed them that the girl was with the
Fairies, and that they could get her back from them, by being careful
to go to a certain spot at the proper time at the end of a year
and a day. They did as they were directed by the "wise man," and to
their great surprise, found the maid among the fairies dancing and
singing with them, and seemed as happy as a fish in the water. Then
they successfully drew her out of the ring, and they took her home
safely. The master had been told by the "Wise Man" that the girl
was not to be touched by iron, or she would disappear at once after
getting her out of the ring.

One day, however, when her master was about to start from home,
and whilst he was getting the horse and cart ready, he asked the
girl to assist him, which she did willingly; but as he was bridling
the horse, the bit touched the girl and she disappeared instantly,
and was never seen from that day forth.
