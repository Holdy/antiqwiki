summary: In old folk stories, magicians like Sir Dafydd Llwyd and Sir Dafydd Sion Evan were believed to ride through the air on demon-horses, with tales of their journeys spanning across Wales and Scotland. One such tale involves Sir Michael Scott, who used a demon-horse to travel to France as an ambassador, demonstrating his power by making the horse's stamp shake the structures of Paris.
