THE PIGEON.

It is said that if a sick person asks for a pigeon's pie, or the flesh
of a pigeon, it is a sign that his death is near. There is also a
superstition that people cannot die in ease if there are pigeon's
feathers in their pillows. A writer in "Bye-Gones" refers to the
case of a woman who died in 1803 at a farm-house called Southern
Pills in the Parish of Lawrenny, Pembrokeshire, and states that on
her death-bed the nurse snatched the pillow from under her head.
