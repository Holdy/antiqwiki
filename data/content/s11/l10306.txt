CWN ANNWN--HELL HOUNDS.

Cwn Annwn were supposed to have been supernatural hounds whose yelling
or howling on dark nights foreboded a death. If the howling was faint,
it meant that the pack was close at hand, if loud, the hounds were
only hunting at a distance. These hounds were supposed to watch for
the souls of notoriously wicked men about to die.

An old farmer, named Mr. Thomas Stephens, Llwyncelyn, Llanarth,
Cardiganshire, informed me that his brother once heard the bark of
these hounds on the road near Bronwen.
