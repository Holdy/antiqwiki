THE GLANFREAD FAWR GHOST REVEALING HIDDEN MONEY TO THE HOUSEMAID.

Glanfread is a respectable farm house, but in former days it was a
mansion of some note, situated in the North of Cardiganshire. In
connection with Glanfread there is a ghost tale, and I found the
best version of it in a Welsh manuscript kindly lent me by Dr. James,
Lodge Park, Talybont:--

Once upon a time there lived at this house an old gentleman whose two
nieces on one occasion came to spend with him their Christmas holidays
at Glanfread. One evening, the two young ladies, who were sisters,
and the housemaid sat down late playing cards. As they kept on playing
till a very late hour, the fire was going out, and they began to feel
cold; so the maiden went out of the house for some firewood in order
to warm themselves before retiring to bed. For some reason or other,
however, she was very long in returning with the wood to put on the
fire, and when she did return, she fell on the floor in a swoon,
that they were obliged to carry her to bed. Next morning when they
asked what had caused her to faint, she declined giving any reply;
and even when her master, gun in hand, threatened to take her life
unless she confessed what had happened, she still persisted in keeping
all the mystery to herself. The fact of it was, the girl kept company
to one of the farm servants, if not engaged, and very soon they were
married, and took a very large farm--a farm which is well-known
in North Cardiganshire. All their acquaintances were very greatly
surprised how could a poor servant man and servant woman afford to
begin farming on such a large scale, when it was known that they
had but very little money to start on such an undertaking. And the
general opinion was that a spirit had revealed to the servant woman
some hidden treasure on the night she fainted.
