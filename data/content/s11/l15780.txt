LLANGADOCK.

An old man, named John Jones, informed me that Llangadock was a
large town in ancient times; but that a part of it sunk. According
to tradition, a church stood once where Pwll y Clychau--the Pool of
the Bells--is now, and the old man added that people still hear the
sound of the bells at the bottom of the pool. There is a stone in
the river Sawdde, known as Coitan Arthur, respecting which there is
a tradition that it was thrown down from the top of Pen Arthur--about
a mile distant--by Arthur the Giant.
