FFYNON BECCA.

Another well-known well of great repute in Carmarthenshire, is
Becca's Well, between Newcastle Emlyn and Llandyssul. This well is
still thought by many to possess health-restoring qualities, and its
water cured both gravel and diseased eyes. It was much resorted to
within living memory.
