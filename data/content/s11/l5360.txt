MR. EDWARD JONES, PENCWM, LLANRHYSTID, AND THE FAIRIES.

Mr. Edward Jones, Pencwm, who only died about 8 years ago, was coming
home from Lampeter one moonlight night, and when he came to the top
of Trichrug hill, he saw the Fairies dancing in a field close to
the road. When he was within a certain distance of them he felt as
if his feet were almost lifted up from the ground, and his body so
light that he could almost stand in the air.

My informant, Mr. D. Morgan, Carpenter, Llanrhystid, added that
Mr. Jones was an intelligent and educated man, who had travelled,
and was far from being superstitious.
