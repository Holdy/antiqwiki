ANOTHER CARDIGANSHIRE WOMAN WITCHED.

An old man living in the parish of Llangwyryfon, seven miles from
Aberystwyth, named Jenkin Williams, told me the following story six
years ago when he was 89 years of age, and vouched for the truth of the
account:--A certain woman who lived in that parish was supposed to be
a witch, and it was said she had a brother a wizard: Her husband was
a shoemaker. Another woman who used to go back and fore to the town
of Aberystwyth, with a donkey-cart, refused on one occasion to bring
some leather to the supposed witch and her husband. Soon after this,
the woman was taken ill, and the shoemaker's wife was suspected of
having witched her. The son of the sick woman went to Cwrt-y-Cadno
in Carmarthenshire to consult the "Dyn Hysbys." The conjurer told
the young man to go home as soon as possible, and that he should see
the person who caused his mother's indisposition coming to the house
on his return home. When the son reached home who should enter the
house but the supposed witch, and as soon as she came in she spoke
in Welsh to his mother something as follows:--"Mae'n ddrwg genyf eich
bod mor wael, ond chwi wellwch eto, Betti fach." (I am sorry you are
so unwell, but you will get well again, Betty dear). The sick woman
recovered immediately!
