THE MAGPIE AND THE WOOD-PIGEON.

"The Magpie, observing the slight knowledge of nest building possessed
by the wood-pigeon, kindly undertook the work of giving his friend
a lesson in the art, and as the lesson proceeded, the Wood-pigeon,
bowing, cooed out:--


    Mi wn! Mi wn! Mi wn!
    I know! I know! I know!


The instructor was at first pleased with his apt pupil, and proceeded
with his lesson, but before another word could be uttered, the bird,
swelling with pride at its own importance and knowledge, said again:--


    I know! I know! I know!


The Magpie was annoyed at this ignorant assurance, and with bitter
sarcasm said: 'Since you know, do it then,' and this is why the wood
pigeon's nest is so untidy in our days. In its own mind it knew all
about nest building and was above receiving instruction, and hence its
clumsy way of building its nest. This fable gave rise to a proverb,
"As the wood pigeon said to the magpie: 'I know.'" Iolo MSS., page 567.
