THE HOLY WELL OF ST. GWENOG.

St. Gwenog's Well is close to the graveyard walls of the Church of
Llanwenog, which is situated about six miles from Lampeter, and two
from Llanybyther. The well was once much resorted to, even within
memory of people who are still alive, as its water was considered
very beneficial, especially to wash children whose backs were weak.
