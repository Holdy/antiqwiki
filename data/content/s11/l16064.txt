CHALKING THE DOOR-STEP.

The following appeared in the "Western Mail," December 3rd, 1910:--

According to a work just published on South Pembrokeshire, the custom
prevailing in that part of the country of chalking the door-step dates
back to Druidical times. The object of this chalking was to keep evil
spirits out of the house. The patterns run round the slated steps,
and, elaborate as they often are, the essential thing is that there
should be no gap in them, because the evil spirits could enter into
the house through the gaps. Does this custom prevail in all parts
of Wales? It undoubtedly does in Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire,
Glamorgan, and Pembrokeshire.
