FLYING SERPENTS--GWIBEROD.

The Welsh name Gwiber means a flying snake, or a flying serpent,
an imaginary creature supposed to be a kind of dragon. There are
traditions of these dangerous creatures in several parts of Wales; and
it was formerly believed that a snake, by drinking the milk of a woman,
became transformed into a flying serpent. This superstition was very
common in the southern part of Cardiganshire until very recently. A few
years ago when staying for a short time at Talybont in the northern
part of the same county, a rocky spot was pointed out to me, about a
mile from the village, where, according to tradition, a Gwiber which
attacked people, had a lurking place in former times. There is also
a tradition in the parish of Trelech, Carmarthenshire, that a Gwiber
lurked in that neighbourhood once upon a time. At last the creature
was shot.
