MERMAIDS.

It seems probable that the tradition of Mermaids is of the same origin
as that of fairies.

In Campbell's Superstitions of the Scottish Highlands, it is stated
that a man in North Harris, caught a mermaid on a rock, and to
procure her release, she granted him his three wishes. He became
a skilful herb-doctor, who could cure the King's evil and other
diseases ordinarily incurable. This reminds us of the Fairy Lady of
Llyn y Fanfach in Carmarthenshire, revealing to her sons the medical
qualities of certain herbs and plants, thus enabling them to become
eminent doctors.

In the Welsh tales the mermaid is described as half woman and half
fish: above the waist a lovely woman, but below the waist like a
fish. There are several mermaid stories on the west coast of Wales,
or perhaps, different versions of the same tale.

It was believed that vengeance overtook those who showed cruelty to
these beings, and there is a tradition still extant in Carmarthenshire,
that a man who killed one of them in the neighbourhood of Pembrey, or
Kidwelly, brought a curse upon himself, his family and his descendants
until the ninth generation.

In times gone by, it seems that Cardiganshire with a sea-coast of about
fifty miles, was noted for its mermaids; and according to Dryton,
at the Battle of Agincourt, the county had "a mermaid sitting on a
rock," as armorial bearings.
