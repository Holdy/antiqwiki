BIRD SINGING HEARD BEFORE DEATH.

In the excellent Welsh Magazine "Y Brython" for January, 1860, page
40, the following remarkable incident is given in connection with the
death of the famous poet and clergyman, Tegid, which, being translated
is as follows:--

"In his absence from Church, when lying on his death-bed, in the
morning of the Lord's Day, whilst a neighbouring clergyman was taking
the service for him in Llanhyfer Church, the voice of the reader was
suddenly drowned by the beautiful song of a thrust, that filled the
whole church.... It was ascertained on leaving the church that at that
very moment the soul of Tegid left his body for the world of spirits."
