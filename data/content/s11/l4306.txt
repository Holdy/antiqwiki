KNAPPAN.

This ancient game takes its name from the ball used, which was some
hard wood, and well greased for each occasion and just small enough
to be grasped in one hand. Running with the ball was the chief method,
and the distance between the goals was several miles.

George Owen, of Henllys, in Pembrokeshire, gives a full account of
Knappan, and how it was played in the time of Queen Elizabeth, and
it seems that the ancient game survived the longest in the northern
part of that county, and the South of Cardiganshire, and on Corpus
Christi Day there was a regular contest between the two districts,
when 2,000 came together, and some horsemen as well. The game was
regarded as the best training for war.

It is thought that the great football contests between Llandyssul and
Llanwenog which were popular on Good Fridays about seventy years ago,
were the outcome of the ancient game of Knappan.
