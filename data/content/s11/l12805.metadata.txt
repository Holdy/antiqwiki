summary: In Cardiganshire, a farmer whose cattle were bewitched sought the help of a wizard in Llangurig who revealed the perpetrator through a magic mirror, agreeing only to punish the offender rather than cause them fatal harm. Similarly, in Tregaron, a conjurer marked a man who had used the 'Evil Eye' on a woman by magically causing a horn to appear on his forehead.
