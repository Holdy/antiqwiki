THE WELL OF FFOSANNA.

This well is also in Carmarthenshire, in the parish of Cyuwil
Elvet. There was hardly a well in the county more celebrated in former
times than "Ffynon Ffosanna," and there are traditions still extant
in the neighbourhood, that many of the cripples who resorted here,
went home healed.
