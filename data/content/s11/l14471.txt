ST. LEONARD'S WELL.

This well, which is situated in the parish of Rudbaxton, in the
neighbourhood of Haverfordwest, was once much made use of for its
medical properties, especially by those who were suffering from sore
eyes. There was once a St. Leonard's Chapel a short distance from
the well, though St. Leonard was not a Welsh Saint.

The Chalybeate Wells, Gumfreston, Tenby, had a great reputation once
for their healing virtues.
