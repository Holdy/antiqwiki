MUSIC OF ANGELS HEARD BEFORE DEATH.

It is stated in the "Cambro-British Saints," page 444, that previous
to the death of St. David "the whole city was filled with the music
of angels."

The Rev. Edmund Jones in his "Apparitions in Wales," says that at
the death of one Rees David in Carmarthenshire, "a man of more than
common piety," several persons who were in the room heard "the singing
of angels drawing nearer and nearer; and after his death they heard
the pleasant incomparable singing gradually depart until it was out
of hearing."



CYHYRAETH: OR DEATH SOUND.

The Cyhyraeth was another death portent. It has been described as
a wailing or moaning sound heard before a death, and it was thought
to be a sound made by a groaning spirit. This spirit was never seen,
only its sound was heard.

According to "British Goblins" by Sikes, one David Prosser,
of Llanybyther, heard the Cyhyraeth pronouncing the words
"Woolach! Woolach!" before a funeral.

According to the same book "this crying spirit, especially affected
the twelve parishes in the hundred of Inis Cenin, which lie on
the south-east side of the river Towy, 'where some time past it
groaned before the death of every person who lived that side of the
country! It also sounded before the death of persons 'who were born
in these parishes, but died elsewhere.'

"Sometimes, the voice was heard long before death, but not longer than
a quarter of a year. So common was it in the district named, that among
the people there is a familiar form of reproach to any one making a
disagreeable noise, or children crying or groaning unreasonably was
to ejaculate 'Oh'r Cyhyraeth!' A reason why Cyhyraeth was more often
heard in the hundred of Inis Cenin, was thought to be that Non, the
mother of St. David lived in those parts where a village is called
after her name Llanon."
