THE SPIRIT OF A DEAD MOTHER APPEARING TO HER CHILDREN.

The following story was related to me by Mr. Brutus Davies, who died
at Aberystwyth about two years ago, and who vouched for the truth of
the account:--

About seventy years ago a certain man who was working on the Estate
of Col. ---- in the parish of Llangeler, Carmarthenshire, had buried
his first wife and had married again. He had several children from
his first wife, but not one from the second. One particular day,
the children went out to play as they often did. When they came to
a certain spot which served them as a playground, they found some
small cakes on the ground, which were very tempting to children;
but just as they were going to eat them, the spirit of their dead
mother appeared on the scene and addressed them as follows:--"My dear
children, don't eat those cakes, for there is poison in them!" When
this strange occurrence became known in the neighbourhood, people
suspected the step-mother of having intentionally and secretly placed
the cakes on the children's playground.

Sometimes we hear of the appearance of the ghost of a child, especially
if a baby has been ill-treated or murdered, and the following story
is well-known in the Northern part of Cardiganshire.
