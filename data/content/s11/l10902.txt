THE WREN--Y DRYW.

It seems from the following Welsh rhyme that the wren was also a
sacred bird:--


   "Pwy bynag doro nyth y dryw,
    Ni wel byth mo wyneb Duw."

    (Whoever breaks a wren's nest
    Shall never know the Heavenly rest.)


It was once customary in Pembrokeshire to carry a wren round the
houses during the Christmas holidays. I have given a full account of
this custom in another chapter.

How the wren became king of the birds, is related in the next
paragraph.
