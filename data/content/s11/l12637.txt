SIR RHYS AP THOMAS CONSULTING A WIZARD CONCERNING KING HENRY VII.

When the Earl of Richmond (afterwards Henry VII.) was about to land
in Wales from France on his way to Bosworth, Sir Rhys Ap Thomas,
consulted a well-known wizard and prophet, who dwelt at Dale, as to
whether the Earl would be successful to dethrone Richard III. After
much hesitation, and at the urgent demand of Sir Rhys, the Conjurer
on the next day prophesied in rhyme as follows:--


   "Full well I wend, that in the end
    Richmond, sprung from British race.
    From out this land the boare shall chase."


The "Boare" meant Richard III. See "Life of Sir Rhys Ap Thomas,"
by M. E. James, page 49.
