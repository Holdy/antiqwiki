CATTLE.

Many of the farmers are very much perturbed when a cow brings forth
two calves. A few years ago a farmer's wife in the parish of Llangybi,
near Lampeter, informed me that one of the cows had twin calves, and
that she was very anxious to sell the animal as soon as possible, as
such an incident was considered an omen of ill-luck or a very great
misfortune to the family or the owner. This superstition is very
general in Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire; but I have heard that
in some parts of North Wales a contrary view is taken of such an event.

When the first calf of the season happens to be a male one, it is
a sign of a successful year to its owner, but the contrary, if the
calf is a she one.

If the new born calf is seen by the mistress of the house with its
head towards her, as she enters the cowhouse to view her new charge
and property, it is a good omen. It is also considered a good sign to
find the cattle wild and difficult to manage on the way to the fair;
for you'll sell them to your advantage.
