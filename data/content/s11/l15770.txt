LLANILAR.

The present vicar, the Rev. J. F. Lloyd, remembers hearing from
an old lady, that when she was a little girl, it was customary for
the women of the parish to curtsy to an oil painting of the Blessed
Virgin Mary, on entering the church. It seems that there was a holy
well once known as Ffynnon Drindod not far from Llanilar.
