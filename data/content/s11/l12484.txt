WIZARDS REVEALING THE FUTURE.

It was believed that conjurers could tell fortunes, or reveal the
hidden future, and a good many, especially young people, consulted
them.

The following is a copy of a card which Harries of Cwrt-y-cadno
distributed:--



"NATIVITY CALCULATED."

In which are given the general transactions of the Native through life,
viz:--Description (without seeing the person), temper, disposition,
fortunate, or unfortunate in their general pursuits; honour, riches,
journeys, and voyages (success therein, and what places best to travel
to, or reside in); friends, and enemies, trade, or profession best
to follow; whether fortunate in speculation, viz: Lottery, dealing
in Foreign Markets, etc., etc., etc. Of marriage, if to marry.--The
description, temper, and disposition of the person, from whence,
rich or poor, happy or unhappy in marriage, etc., etc. Of children,
whether fortunate or not, etc., etc., deduced from the influence of
the Sun and Moon, with the Planetary Orbs at the time of birth. Also,
judgment and general issue in sickness and diseases, etc.

By Henry Harries.

"All letters addressed to him or his father, Mr. John Harries,
Cwrtycadno, must be post paid, or will not be received."
