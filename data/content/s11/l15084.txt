TWM SHION CATTI'S CAVE.

                           "Mae llefain mawr a gwaeddi,
                            Yn Ystradffin eleni;
                            Mae'r ceryg nadd yn toddi'n blwm,
                            Rhag ofn twm Sion Catti."

                            (In Ystradffin a doleful sound
                            Pervades the hollow hills around;
                            The very stones with terror melt,
                            Such tear of Twm Shion Catti's felt.)


This cave, which is near Ystradffin, on the borders of Carmarthenshire
and Cardiganshire, was once, says tradition, the stronghold of Twm
Shion Catti, or to give him his proper name Thomas Jones. This
Thomas Jones, or Twm Shion Catti, lived at Tregaron in the time
of Queen Elizabeth. It seems that he had been in his younger days
a freebooter, but reformed and became a celebrated bard, antiquary
and a genealogist. The legends which have gathered round the name of
this eminent man, are still retained in the memory of the people in
Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire, and the late Mr. T. J. L. Prichard,
of Llandovery, made him the hero of a most popular romance, into
whose book the stories have been introduced, and embellished.
