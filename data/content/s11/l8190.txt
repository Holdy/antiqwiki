A GHOST HAUNTING A YOUNG LOVER WHO WAS OUT LATE AT NIGHT, NEAR
ALLTWALIS IN CARMARTHENSHIRE.

An old man named Griffiths, who is 96 years of age, and lives at
'Renallt Farm, near Carmarthen, gave me the following ghost story
concerning his own father.

William Griffiths (my informant's father), when a young man, nearly a
hundred years ago, was engaged as a servant at a farm called Pontiauar,
in the Parish of Llanpumpsaint. William had been out late one night
to see the young woman of his affection, and having enjoyed the
pleasure of love for some hours, he returned home about three o'clock
in the morning. He had some miles to go through a lonely district,
and worse than that he had to pass the Haunted Red Gate of Glynadda,
a place famous for its ghosts in former times.

On he walked as fast as he could, but to his great terror, when
he came to the Red Gate the ghost appeared in the shape of a big
man. William passed on and ran, but the Ghost followed him all the
way to the village of Llanpumpsaint, till the young man was terrified
almost to death. When he arrived at the house of Dafydd Llwyd, the
Blacksmith (who worked even at that early hour), he entered the house
or the Blacksmith's shop, and fell down near the fire half-fainting,
and they had to take him home to the farmhouse in a cart.
