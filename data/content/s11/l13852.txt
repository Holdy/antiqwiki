THE CURE OF RICKETS.

The complaint which is called in West Wales "llechau" means rickets,
a complaint to which children are subject. It was thought that it could
be cured by cutting a slit in the lobe of one of the child's ears. The
practice was once common in Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire and other
parts; and Mr. H. W. Williams, of Solva, mentions in "Cambrian Notes
and Queries," for January 11th., 1902, of a man in the Rhondda Valley
who had recently cut the rickets. He was a Cardiganshire man.
