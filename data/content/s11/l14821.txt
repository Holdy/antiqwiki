LAKES.


LLYN MOEL LLYN.

This is a lake in the parish of Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn, North
Cardiganshire. There is a saying that every bird that attempts to
fly over this lake, falls into it dead. There is also a tradition in
the neighbourhood that when an attempt was made to drain the lake,
terrific thunder and lightning compelled them to give up the attempt.
