A FAMILIAR SPIRIT IN THE SHAPE OF A DOG AND THE LONELY NIGHT TRAVELLER.

On one occasion a certain man from Cilcwm, was on a visit in the
neighbourhood of Cwrtycadno. When he started to return home it was
getting rather late, and he had a long journey to go through a lonely
mountainous country. The wizard, Dr. Harries, asked him if he was
afraid of such a journey over the mountain in the depth of night. The
man confessed that he did not like such a journey at that late hour
without a single soul to accompany him, but that he was obliged to
go home that night without fail; and so he proceeded on his way. As
he journeyed along, the darkness of night overtook him on his way
over the mountain, but to his great surprise, when he looked around
him, he noticed a black dog following him, or rather walking by his
side. The dog was very friendly, and the lonely traveller felt glad
of the animal's company. So on they went together; but when they
were nearing his home the dog vanished suddenly into nothing. The man
was quite convinced that the dog was nothing but a familiar Spirit,
in the shape of a dog, sent by the wizard to bear him company in his
lonely night journey.

The above story was related to me by the Rev. J. Phillips, vicar
of Llancynfelyn.
