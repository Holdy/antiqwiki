summary: St. Edren's was home to a famous sacred well known for healing powers, particularly against hydrophobia, which dried up when a woman washed her clothes in it on a Sunday. Despite this, the healing properties of the well's water were believed to have transferred to the churchyard grass, which people would consume to cure their ailments.
