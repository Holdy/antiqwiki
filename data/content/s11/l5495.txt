A CARMARTHENSHIRE MAIDEN WHO GOT INTO A FAIRY RING.

In the parish of Cynwil Elvet, there is a farmhouse called Fos Anna,
a place which was known to the writer of this book once when a boy:--

A servant girl at this farm once went rather late in the evening
to look for the cows, and, unfortunately, got into the Fairy ring,
and although she had been a long period without food she did not
feel hungry.
