PILLS OF DEAD MEN'S BONES.

Pentrevor, in the "Pembroke County Guardian," says:--I have a valuable
recipe for quack doctors. Mr. George Williams, knows of a young
lady who was one day cleaning a window when a flash of lightning
so frightened her that she became subject to fits. As an infallible
cure, someone suggested that a dead man's bone be procured. Llanwnda
Churchyard was visited for the purpose, while a new grave was being
dug, and dead men's bones were thrown up by the spade. A bone was
found and cleaned, ground into powder and made into pills, which the
patient took, and was completely cured.
