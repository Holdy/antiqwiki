THE CANDLE AND PIN DIVINATION.

It was also the custom, at least many years ago, if not now, for a
young woman, or two of them together to stick pins at midnight in a
candle, all in a row, right from its top to the bottom, and then to
watch the candle burning and the pins dropping one by one, till the
last pin had dropped, and then the future husband of the girl to whom
the pin belonged, was supposed to appear; but if she was destined to
die single, she would see a coffin.

Another form of Divination, was to put the plates on the dining-room
table upside down, and at midnight the spirit of the future husband
was supposed to come and arrange them in their proper order.

Another custom resorted to in Cardiganshire and other parts in order to
see a future husband, or rather to dream of him, was to eat a hen's
first egg; but no one was to know the secret, and absolute silence
was to be observed, and the egg was to be eaten in bed.
