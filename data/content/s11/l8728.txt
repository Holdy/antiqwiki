THE LEGEND OF THE DEVIL'S BRIDGE IN CARDIGANSHIRE.

The Devil's Bridge in the northern part of Cardiganshire is so called
from the tradition that it was erected by him upon the condition that
the first thing that passed over it should be his. The story which
is well-known is something as follows:

An old woman called Megan Llandunach had lost her cow, and espied the
animal across the gorge. When bewailing her fate, the Devil appeared
and promised to build her a bridge over the gorge under the condition
that the first living thing which crossed should be surrendered into
his hand, "and be beyond redemption lost." Megan agreed, the bridge
was completed; she took from her pocket a crust of bread and threw
it over the bridge, and her hungry dog sprang after it. So the Devil
was balked in his design after all his trouble in erecting the bridge.
