TALLEY LAKES.

Talley Lakes are close to the remains of the fine old Abbey, and not
far from Edwinsford, the country seat of Sir James Drummond, Bart.,
Lord Lieutenant of Carmarthenshire. Respecting these lakes also there
is a tradition that a town lies beneath their waters.

Such traditions of towns lying buried beneath lakes are common to
many lakes, both in Wales, and other countries. Such traditions have
probably come down from pre-historic times, when people dwelt in lake
habitations, and in caves, for safety from the beasts of the forest as
well as from human foes. Traces of lake dwelling have been discovered
in Switzerland and in other countries.
