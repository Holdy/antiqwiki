THE COCK.

It is very curious that some people think that it is very lucky to
possess a white cock and a black cat, whilst others look upon them
with extreme disfavour.


   "Na chadw byth yng ynghylch dy dy,
    Na cheiliog gwyn na chath ddu."

    (Never keep about thy house,
    A white cock, nor a black cat.)


A cock crowing in the day-time before the door announces the visit
of a friend; but should he crow at night before or about midnight,
it is considered a sign of death.

Cock-fighting was once common in Wales, and spots have been pointed
out to me here and there, in Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire where
such fights took place.
