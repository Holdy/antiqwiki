summary: A Pembrokeshire woman named Mrs. Evans, known for her prophetic visions, predicted seeing a series of autonomous, fast-moving carts in Trefgarn Valley, which locals later interpreted as a foretelling of a railway line that was ultimately constructed nearly 100 years later. Despite setbacks and ridicule when initial railway projects bypassed the area, a new line was eventually built exactly as Evans had envisioned, fulfilling her long-dismissed prophecy.
