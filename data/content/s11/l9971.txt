THE CORPSE BIRD.

The most common death prognosticator throughout Wales in the present
day is a peculiar bird known as "Deryn Corph" (Corpse Bird)--a bird
flapping its wings against the window of the room in which there is
a sick person. This was considered an omen of death. Even in the
present day most people dread to see or hear a bird flapping its
wings against the window when there is a sick person in the house;
but every bird is not a corpse bird.

An old woman in Pembrokeshire, Miss Griffiths, Henllan, near Eglwyswrw,
told me this bird is a little grey one and that it came flapping
against her own window before the death of her father, and also before
the death of each of her three uncles.

I have met with people in almost every district throughout the country
who have heard the flappings of this mysterious bird before a death.
