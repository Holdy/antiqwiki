THE EMPLOYMENT OF DOGS TO TURN ROASTING-SPITS.

It was customary in former times to place a dog inside a wheel which
he turned with his fore-feet, the wheel being connected by a chain
with the wheel end of the spit.

There was a dog employed in turning the roasting-spit in this manner
at Newcastle Emlyn about one hundred years ago.
