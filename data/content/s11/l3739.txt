EASTER.

It is deemed essential by many people to wear some new article of
dress, if only a pair of gloves or a new ribbon; for not to do so
is considered unlucky, and the birds will be angry with you. It is
probable that the origin of this custom is associated with Easter
baptism, when a new life was assumed by the baptised, clothed in
righteousness as a garment. In former times people had such respect
for this day that many kept their children unbaptised till Easter
Sunday, and many old men and old women went to Church to receive the
Communion who were hardly to be seen in the Lord's House on any other
Sunday during the year.

There was once an old fancy in Wales that the sun used to dance for
joy when it rose on Easter morning, and great care was taken in some
places to get up the children and young people to see such sight of the
sun dancing in honour of the rising of our Lord. The sun was sometimes
aided in this performance by a bowl of clear water, into which the
youth must look and see the orb dance, as it would be dangerous to
look directly on the sun while thus engaged. The religious dance of
the ancient Druids is believed to exist in modern times in a round
dance wherein the figures imitate the motions of the sun and moon. See
"British Goblins," by Sykes, page 274.
