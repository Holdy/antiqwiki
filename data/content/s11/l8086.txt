ALLT Y CRIB GHOST, NEAR TALYBONT.

About sixty years ago, the dead body of a little baby was found in
a hole or an old mine shaft, known till the present day as "Shaft y
plentyn" (the child's shaft), and as the people of the neighbourhood
of Talybont guessed who its mother was, there was a rumour that both
she and her family were haunted by the child's ghost. This ghost also,
it is said, wandered about at night, and its bitter crying disturbed
the whole neighbourhood, till many timid people were afraid to go
out after dark. My informant was the late J. Jones, Bristol House.

There is a similar story of a child's ghost in the parish of
Troedyraur, South Cardiganshire. This spirit always appeared as a
child dressed in yellow clothes, and on that account the unearthly
visitor was known as "Bwci Melyn Bach y Cwm."
