THE HOLY WELL OF LLANFIHANGEL GENEU'R GLYN.

This well is about four miles north from Aberystwyth, in
Cardiganshire. It is situated quite close to the eastern wall of
the Churchyard of Llanfihangel Parish Church. This well has been,
and perhaps still is, held in honour for its curative virtues. It is
surrounded by a small building and within a few years of the present
time, people in search of health took the trouble of coming from
long distances to drink from and to bathe in its waters. When the
Rev. Z. M. Davies, vicar of the parish, and myself, visited the spot
five years ago, a lady living quite close to the well, informed us,
that a short time previously, a crippled girl from Glamorganshire,
who had come there on crutches, was able to walk away without them,
and left them behind.

Ffynnon Francis, is also a well in the Parish of Llanfihangel
Geneu'r Glyn, on a farm called Penuchaf, and it seems that it was
once popularly esteemed, for there is a tradition at Talybont,
that its waters had the power of restoring sight to a blind old man
named Francis.
