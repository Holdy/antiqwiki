SPIRIT OF A LIVING WOMAN SEEN ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT, NEAR LLANYBRI
IN CARMARTHENSHIRE.

A woman named Mrs. M. Davies, who lives in the small village of
Llanybri, in Carmarthenshire, informed me that her mother when a
young woman, was going home one evening to Llanybri, on a moonlight
night. As she walked along, to her great surprise, she saw an old
woman known in the neighbourhood as Rachel Y Gweydd, or the weaver,
sitting by the roadside and busily engaged in knitting a stocking. The
young woman ran home as fast as she could and told her mother what she
had seen. "Och y fi" said her mother, "something strange is sure to
take place after this." Within a few days a man named Thomas Davies,
of Cwmllan-wybryn, died, and was buried at the Capel Newydd. As the
funeral procession passed along, there was Rachel Y Gweydd sitting
by the roadside, and knitting her stocking at the very same spot
where her spirit had been seen by the young woman on the moon-light
night. The old woman had gone to sit by the roadside in order to
watch the funeral procession passing.

A sister of the above Mrs. Davies, Mrs. Weekes, of Llangynog, also
gave me the following account of her mother's experience of seeing
"Yspryd dyn byw."
