BLOODY CAVE.

There is a cave at Pendine, in Carmarthenshire, in which according to
tradition a gang of most desperate and murderous robbers once made
their headquarters. At last, these scoundrels were attacked by the
people of the neighbourhood, and put to death for murdering a woman
for her money.
