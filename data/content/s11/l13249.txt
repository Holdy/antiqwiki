THE CRIMEAN WAR SEEN IN THE SKIES.

About six months before the outbreak of the Crimean War, in 1853, John
Meyler, Cilciffeth, saw a strange mirage in the sky. He was returning
home late from Morville, and when nearing Penterwin he saw the image
of armies in the skies. There were several battalions at first,
and they increased in number till they spanned the heavens. There
were two opposing forces, and he could distinctly see the image of
men falling and of horses galloping across the firmament, and the
clashing of great masses of men. He was so terrified that he called
at Penbank and called the attention of Mr. James Morris, who lived
at that place at that time, and he saw the same thing. This strange
phenomenon appeared for about two hours.

The above account of this strange vision in the skies appeared
in the "Cardiff Times," a few years ago, sent to that paper by
Cadrawd. Pembrokeshire has always been known as the land of phantasm.
