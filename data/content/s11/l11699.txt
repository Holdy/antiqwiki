A CILCWM STORY.

Mr. Theophilus, the old blacksmith, at Cilcwm, in Carmarthenshire,
told me that when he was a boy the cattle had been witched by an
enemy. They would not touch the grass in the field of their own
farm; but whenever put in any field of another farm they would
graze splendidly. My informant's mother could not understand this,
and she felt very much distressed about it. At last she took the
advice of friends and went to consult the Wizard of Cwrt-y-Cadno,
who informed her that an enemy with whom she was well acquainted,
had witched her cattle. Then he advised her to go home and buy a
new knife, (one that had never been used before), and go directly
to a particular spot in the field where a solitary "pren cerdinen"
(mountain ash) grew, and cut it with this new knife. This mountain
ash, and some of the cows' hair, as well as some "witch's butter"
she was to tie together and burn in the fire; and that by performing
this ceremony or charm, she should see the person who was guilty of
witching her cows, coming to the door or the window of her house. My
informant told me that his mother carried out these directions, and
that everything happened as the wizard had foretold her. After this,
there was nothing wrong with the cows.
