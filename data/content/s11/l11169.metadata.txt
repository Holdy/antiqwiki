summary: In rural Wales, there is a superstition that when a cow gives birth to twin calves, it is a sign of bad luck, prompting some farmers to sell such cows promptly. Conversely, various omens like a calf's gender or its orientation when first seen are believed to predict good fortune for the year in different areas.
