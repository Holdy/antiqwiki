THE SHEPHERD BOY AND THE FAIRIES OF FRENIFAWR.

The following story appeared in the "Cambrian Superstitions," by
W. Howells, a little book published at Tipton in 1831:--

A stripling, of twelve or more years of age, was tending his father's
sheep on a small mountain called Frenifach, it was a fine morning
in June, and he had just driven the sheep to their pasture for the
day, when he looked at the top of Frenifawr to observe which way the
morning fog declined, that he might judge the weather.

If the fog on Frenifawr (a high mountain in Pembrokeshire, 10 miles
from Cardigan) declines to the Pembrokeshire side, the peasants
prognosticated fair, if on the Cardiganshire side foul weather.

To his surprise the boy saw what seemed a party of soldiers sedulously
engaged in some urgent affair; knowing there could not possibly be
soldiers there so early, he with some alarm, looked more minutely,
and perceived they were too diminutive for men; yet, thinking his
eyesight had deceived him, he went to a more elevated situation, and
discovered that they were the "Tylwyth Teg" (Fairies) dancing. He had
often heard of them and had seen their rings in the neighbourhood,
but not till then had the pleasure of seeing them; he once thought of
running home to acquaint his parents, but judging they would be gone
before he returned, and he be charged with a falsehood, he resolved
to go up to them, for he had been informed that the fairies were
very harmless, and would only injure those who attempted to discover
their habitation, so by degrees he arrived within a short distance of
the ring, where he remained some time observing their motions. They
were of both sexes, and he described them as being the most handsome
people he had ever seen, they also appeared enchantingly cheerful,
as if inviting him to enter and join the dance.

They did not all dance, but those who did, never deviated from the
circle; some ran after one another with surprising swiftness, and
others (females), rode on small white horses of the most beautiful
form. Their dresses, although indescribably elegant, and surpassing
the sun in radiance, varied in colour, some being white, others
scarlet, and the males wore a red triplet cap, but the females some
light head-dress, which waved fantastically with the slightest
breeze. He had not remained long ere they made signs for him to
enter, and he gradually drew nearer till at length he ventured to
place one foot in the circle, which he had no sooner done than his
ears were charmed with the most melodious music, which moved him in
the transport of the moment, to enter altogether; he was no sooner
in than he found himself in a most elegant palace, glittering with
gold and pearls; here he enjoyed every variety of pleasure, and
had the liberty to range whatever he pleased, accompanied by kind
attendants beautiful as the howries; and instead of "Tatws a llaeth,"
buttermilk, or fresh boiled flummery, here were the choicest viands
and the purest wine in abundance, brought in golden goblets inlaid
with gems, sometimes by invisible agency, and at other times by the
most beautiful virgins. He had only one restriction, and that was
not to drink, upon any consideration (or it was told him it would
be fatal to his happiness), from a certain well in the middle of
the garden, which contained golden fishes and others of various
colours. New objects daily attracts his attention, and new faces
presented themselves to his view, surpassing, if possible those he
had seen before; new pastimes were continually invented to charm him,
but one day his hopes were blasted, and all his happiness fled in an
instant. Possessing that innate curiosity nearly common to all, he,
like our first parents transgressed, and plunged his hand into the
well, when the fishes instantly disappeared, and, putting the water to
his mouth, he heard a confused shriek run through the garden: in an
instant after, the palace and all vanished away, and to his horror,
he found himself in the very place where he first entered the ring,
and the scenes around, with the same sheep grazing, were just as he
had left them. He could scarcely believe himself, and hoped again,
that he was in the magnificent fairy castle; he looked around, but the
scene was too well known; his senses soon returned to their proper
action, and his memory proved that, although he thought he had been
absent so many years, he had been so only so many minutes.

This tale bears a strange contrast as regards the time the boy thought
he was away, to most of our fairy tales which represent those who
had the pleasure of being with fairies as imagining they had been
dancing only a few minutes, when they had been away for years.
