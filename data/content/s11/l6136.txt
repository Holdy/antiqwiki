A SERVANT OF PERTHRHYS, LLANDDEINIOL, AND THE WHITE FAIRIES.

A very old man named John Jones, who lives at Llanddeiniol, about six
miles from Aberystwyth, informed me that many years ago, when he was a
young man, or a lad of 18, he was engaged as a servant at a farm called
Perthrhys, in that neighbourhood. One evening after supper he went to
the tailor who was making him a suit of clothes; but as the clothes
were not quite ready he had to wait till a late hour before returning
home, but it was a delightful moonlight night. As he proceeded along
a lonely path across a certain moor known as Rhosrhydd, and happened
to look back he was suddenly surprised by seeing two young men or
boys as he thought, coming after him. At first he thought they were
some boys trying to frighten him; but after they had followed him
for a short distance till they came within about 30 or 40 yards of
him, they turned out from the path, and began to jump and to dance,
going round and round as if they followed a ring or a circle just as
we hear of the fairies. They were perfectly white, and very nimble,
and the old man informed me that there was something supernatural both
in their appearance and movements; and that he is convinced to this
day that they could not have been human beings. When he arrived home
at the farm, and related his adventure, every one in the house was
of the opinion that the strange beings he had seen were the Fairies.
