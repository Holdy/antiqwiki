MAY.

The old customs and superstitions in connection with May Day are
unknown in Wales in the present day, once, however, May-day dances
and revelling were most popular, especially in Pembrokeshire, as
the following interesting account which appeared in the "Cambrian
Journal" proves:--

"On May-eve, the inhabitants would turn out in troops, bearing in their
hands boughs of thorn in full blossom, which were bedecked with other
flowers, and then stuck outside the windows of the houses. Maypoles
were reared up in different parts of the town (of Tenby), decorated
with flowers, coloured papers, and bunches of variegated ribbon. On
May-day the young men and maidens would, joining hand in hand, dance
round the May-poles, and "thread the needle," as it was termed. A group
of fifty to a hundred persons would wend their ways from one pole to
another, till they had thus traversed the town. Meeting on their way
other groups, who were coming from an opposite direction, both parties
would form a "lady's chain," and to pass on their respective ways."

The May-pole was once most popular in Wales, but the old custom has
entirely died out, though we still hear occasionally of a May Queen
being selected in some places.
