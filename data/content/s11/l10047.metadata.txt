summary: In Carmarthenshire, before the death of Rees David, a deeply pious man, witnesses in the room reported hearing angelic singing growing closer and then fading away after his passing. Cyhyraeth, a spectral moaning sound, was often heard in the twelve parishes of the hundred of Inis Cenin before deaths, serving as a death omen, and was believed to be the voice of a groaning spirit.
