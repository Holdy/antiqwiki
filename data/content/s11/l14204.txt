HOLY RELICS.


THE NANTEOS CUP.

There is preserved at the mansion of Nanteos, near Aberystwyth, a
sacred healing cup known in Welsh as the "Phiol," which interesting
relic was shown me a few years ago by Mrs. W. B. Powell, to whom, and
to the genial Squire, I am indebted for much kindness and respect. In
the same week an intelligent and wealthy Roman Catholic lady--an
invalid--came all the way from London, as she had such faith in the
efficacy and healing virtues of the Sacred Cup.

The Cup is of a very dark wood and supposed to have been formed from
the wood of the true Cross, and it seems to have been preserved in
the Abbey of Strata Florida. At the time of the Dissolution, the
Abbey, lands and goods, were given to the Stedman family, who also
carefully preserved the relic, and from that family it passed over
to the Powells as well as the demesne.
