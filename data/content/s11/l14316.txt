THE STAFF OF ST. CURIG.

In the Church of St. Harmon, Radnorshire, was once preserved a pastoral
staff supposed to have belonged to St. Curig, the founder of Llangurig,
in Montgomeryshire. Giraldus Cambrensis says that this staff was
"covered on all sides with gold and silver, and resembling in its upper
part the form of a cross; its efficacy has been proved in many cases,
but particularly in the removal of glandular and strenuous swellings."



PENGLOG TEILO (TEILO'S SKULL.)

A relic known as "Penglog Teilo" is still preserved at Llandilo
Llwydiarth, Pembrokeshire. I give a full account of it in my chapter
on Holy Wells.
