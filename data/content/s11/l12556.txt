ANOTHER SIMILAR TALE.

About sixty years ago, Isaac Isaac, Tyllain, Llanarth, in
Cardiganshire, went to Harries, Cwrtycadno, to consult him about
something. The wise man was at the time busy with his harvest,
and he asked Isaac to be as kind as to help him a little for
telling his fortune, and he did so. As they were working together
on the field. Harries asked the young man if he intended going to
London? Isaac said, no, but that he had a letter in his pocket he
wanted to forward to London. Then Harries took the young man to the
house and showed him his future wife in a magic glass. He recognised
her at once as the young woman to whom he was already engaged,
and whom he finally married, though much against the wishes of the
young lady's parents. My informant was Mr. Watkin Evans, Blaenpark,
an old man who lives in the parish of Llanarth.
