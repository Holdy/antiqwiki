CONJURERS AND LUNATICS.

About one hundred years ago there lived in the neighbourhood of
Pencader, a wizard, named Phillips, who was very successful in curing
lunatics. On one occasion, an old woman from Tregroes, near Llandyssul,
took her son to him who had been insane from his birth. The wise man
blew into the young man's face, and informed his mother that he would
be sane for twenty years, and so it happened; but after twenty years
he became insane again as the wizard had predicted.

My informant was Mr. Rees, Maesymeillion, in the parish of Llandyssul,
whose father's uncle remembered the lunatic.

The wizard of Cwrt-y-Cadno was also very successful in curing
lunatics. He would take the insane to the brink of the river and
fire an old flint revolver which would frighten his patient to such
a degree that he fell into the pool.
