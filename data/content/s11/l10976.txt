THE MAGPIE.

I know many people in country places who are pleased to see two or
three magpies going together from left to right when a person starts
on a journey, as they regard it an omen of good luck. But to see a
magpie crossing from the right to the left means ill-luck. Fortunately,
however, a person can make void this bad luck by making a cross on the
road and spit in the middle of it. A raven crossing after the magpie
also makes void the bad luck, according to some; but the superstitions
about the magpie and the raven are very similar.

Should a magpie descend on the back of a cow on the evening the
animal is taken into the cow-house for the winter, it is a bad sign;
but should this occur when the cow is taken out from the cowhouse
for the summer, it is a good omen.

An old woman at Yspytty Ystwyth, informed me that the magpie was a
bird of evil omen; for on the very day before her husband was killed
at the mines, she saw three magpies close to the window.
