WELLS OF THE FIVE SAINTS.

These are five wells or pools in the river, near Llanpumpsaint,
in Carmarthenshire, and I am indebted for the following tradition
concerning them, to old records in the possession of the Rev. Canon
Lloyd, B.D., Vicar of that parish. Llanpumpsaint, of course, means
the "Church of the Five Saints." According to the tradition the five
wells were made use of by the five Saints, and each particular saint
had his particular well. In former times on St. Peter's Day, yearly,
between two and three hundred people got together, some to wash in,
and some to see the wells. In the summer time the people in the
neighbourhood bathed themselves in the wells to cure their aches.
