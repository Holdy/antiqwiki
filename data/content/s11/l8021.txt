THE SPIRIT OF A DEAD MOTHER APPEARING TO HER BOY-SON AT LLANGYNOG,
CARMARTHENSHIRE.

A very old man named Thomas Ticker, who lives at the small village
of Llanybri, gave me the following remarkable account:--

Many years ago when one William Thomas, Pengelly Isaf, Llangynog, was
a little boy of ten or twelve years of age, his mother died. One day
the boy in great sorrow went out into a field which was quite close to
the house, and wept bitterly, almost breaking his heart. Suddenly,
the spirit of his dead mother appeared to him in a white dress,
telling him not to cry, "because" saith she, "your crying gives me
pain, and you need not be in trouble about the future, as there is
plenty of food for thee." The child was on the ground when she spoke,
and when he looked up he beheld his mother vanishing suddenly.

This W. Thomas who saw his mother's spirit, died when a comparatively
young man, but his son, from whom my informant obtained the account
of the vision, lived till eighty years of age, and died about sixty
years ago.
