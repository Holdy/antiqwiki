A SHIP WITCHED.

On a particular occasion nearly sixty years ago, a large number of
the leading gentry and others from all parts of Pembrokeshire went to
witness the launch of H. M. Ship "Cæsar," at Pembroke Dock. Among the
crowd there was an old woman named "Betty Foggy" who was believed to
possess the power of witching. When Betty noticed a lot of gentry going
up the steps to the grand stand, she followed suit with an independent
air; but she was stopped by the police. She struggled hard to have her
way, but was forced back. She felt very angry that she had to yield,
and shouted out loudly: "All right, the ship will not go off," but
the old hag's threat was only laughed at. The usual formalities were
gone through, and weights dropped, and amidst cheering the ship began
to glide away--but not for long, for the "Cæsar" soon became to stand
and remained so till the next tide when she got off by the assistance
of some ships afloat, and other means. The old witch was delighted,
and people believed that she was the cause of the failure to launch
the ship.
