CWRW BACH.

There was once an old custom in Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire, of
making what was known as "Cwrw Bach"; that is, people met at a house
on a certain evening to drink home-brewed beer, and indulge in games,
in order to give the profits from the sale of it to assist helpless
old people and others who were in real poverty. This is not done now,
but we still hear of some farmers in Pembrokeshire, making their own
beer for those who work at the harvest.
