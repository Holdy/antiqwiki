TO EXTRACT A TOOTH WITHOUT PAIN.

"Take some newts, by some called lizards, and those nasty beetles
which are found in ferns during summer time, calcine them in an
iron pot and make a powder thereof. Wet the forefinger of the right
hand, insert it in the powder, and apply it to the tooth frequently,
refraining from spitting it off, when the tooth will fall away without
pain. It is proven."--Physicians of Myddfai.
