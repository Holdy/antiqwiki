A DEMON ASSUMING THE FORM OF A HORSE.

Sir John Williams, Bart, now of Aberystwyth, informed me that when a
boy in the neighbourhood of Gwynfi, Carmarthenshire, he often heard
some of the old people speak of a ghost which haunted the road in
that part of the country in former times. This ghost was known as
"Bwci," and always assumed the form of a horse. It is an old belief
of the Celts that demons assumed the form of horses, and one of these
mythic beings was the Water Horse, so well-known in North Scotland. It
was also known in Wales once.
