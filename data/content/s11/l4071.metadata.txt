summary: In West Wales, particularly in Cardiganshire, farmers practiced 'Cynnos,' a custom where they gathered to dry corn in kilns the night before grinding, turning the process into a social event with games and storytelling, known as 'Shimli.' As the corn dried, participants indulged in activities and sometimes drank 'Fetchin' beer, culminating in a traditional gathering that brought together neighbors and friends for a night-long celebration.
