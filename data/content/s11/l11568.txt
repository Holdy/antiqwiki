MILK THAT WOULD NOT CHURN AND THE WITCH.

Many believe, and some still believe, especially in Cardiganshire,
that when milk would not churn that witches had cursed it. An old
woman at Ystrad Meurig, who was supposed to be a witch, called one
day at a farm house and begged for butter, but being refused she
went away in a very bad temper. The next time they churned the milk
would not turn to butter, and they had to throw it out as they were
afraid of giving it to the pigs. When they were churning the second
time again the milk would not turn to butter as usual. But instead
of throwing out the milk as before, they went to the old woman and
forced her to come to the farmhouse and undo her spell. She came
and put her hand on the churn, and the milk successfully turned to
butter. My informant was Mrs. Edwards, Ysbytty Ystwyth.
