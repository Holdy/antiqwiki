ABRACADABRA.

One of the most famous and popular charms in the central parts of
Wales--especially Cardigan and Carmarthenshire--was the magic and
mysterious word Abracadabra, which was obtained from wizards by paying
a certain sum of money for it. The word was inscribed on a paper or
parchment, line under line, repeating the same, but with one letter
less in each line till it ended in A, as follows:--


                         A B R A C A D A B R A
                          A B R A C A D A B R
                           A B R A C A D A B
                            A B R A C A D A
                             A B R A C A D
                              A B R A C A
                               A B R A C
                                A B R A
                                 A B R
                                  A B
                                   A


There are many people even at the present day in West and Mid-Wales who
keep this mystic cabala in their houses as a most valuable treasure. It
is called "papur y Dewin" (the wizard's paper). It was considered a
protection against witches and the "evil eye," as well as all other
evil influences; and an antidote against fevers. It was effective to
protect both persons and animals, houses, etc. Sometimes it was worn
round the neck, or on the breast, at other times carried in the pocket,
and kept in the house. It was also the custom to rub the charm over
cattle or to tie it round their horns, especially when witchcraft
was suspected.

This mysterious word, Abracadabra, to which the superstitious
attributed such magical power was, according to some, invented by
one Basilides, and that he intended the name of God by it. Others
say that it was the name of an ancient heathen deity worshipped in
Syria, or in Assyria. Dr. Ralph Bathurst is of the opinion that the
word is a corrupt Hebrew: dabar is verbu, and abraca is benedixit;
that is verbum benedixit.

As the charm appears very much like a pyramid (though upside down),
perhaps that has something to do with the superstition concerning its
magical power: anything in the shape of a pyramid is considered very
lucky, quite as much as--if not more so--than a horse-shoe.
