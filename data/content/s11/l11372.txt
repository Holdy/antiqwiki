A CARDIGANSHIRE GIRL WHO HAD BEEN WITCHED.

I obtained the following story from David Pugh, Erwlwyd,
Carmarthenshire, an old farmer who is over 90 years of age:--

A woman from Cardiganshire whose daughter was very ill and thought
to have been bewitched, came to the Wizard of Cwrt-y-Cadno, in
Carmarthenshire to consult him. The wise man wrote some mystic words
on a bit of paper, which he gave to the woman, telling her that if
her daughter was not better when she arrived home to come to him
again. The woman went home with the paper, and to her great joy found
the girl fully recovered from her illness. My informant knew the woman,
as she had called at his house.
