THE LLANLLWNI WELL.

In the parish of Llanllwni, Carmarthenshire, there is a well called
Ffynon Garedig, which seems to have been famous once. There is an old
saying that if you hold your two arms in this well for a certain length
of time, you will find out whether you are healthy or unhealthy. If
one's arms are red when taken out of the water, it is a sign of good
health, but if white, a sign of bad health.
