APPARITIONS OF GOOD SPIRITS.

It is not, often we hear in Wales of Good Spirits appearing; but the
Rev. Edmund Jones in his "Relation of Apparitions," a curious old
book published some generations ago, gives the following narrative
of Apparitions of Good Spirits:--

----"There lived at a place called Pante, which is between Carmarthen
and Laugharne towns, one Mr. David Thomas, a holy man, who worship the
Lord with great devotion and humility; he was also a gifted brother,
and sometimes preached. On a certain night, for the sake of privacy,
he went into a room which was out of the house, but nearly adjoining to
it, in order to read and pray; and as he was at prayer, and very highly
taken up into a heavenly frame, the room was suddenly enlightened,
and to that degree that the light of the candle was swallowed up by
a greater light, and became invisible; and with, or in that light
a company of Spirits, like children, in bright clothing, appeared
very beautiful, and sung; but he recollected only a few words of it,
'Pa hyd? Pa hyd? Dychwelwch feibion Adda' (How long? How long? Return
ye sons of Adam.) Something like Ps. xc. 3. After a time he lost
sight of them: the light of the candle again came to appear, when the
great light of the glorious company was gone. He was immersed in the
heavenly disposition, and he fell down to thank and praise the Lord;
and while he was at this heavenly exercise the room enlightened again;
the light of the candle became invisible, and the glorious company
sung; but he was so amazed at what he saw and heard that he could
remember only the following words, 'Pa hyd? Pa hyd yr erlidiwch?' (How
long? How long, will ye persecute the godly Christians?)

"After a while, they departed, and the candle light appeared. Any
Christian who enjoyed much of God's presence will easily believe
that D. T. was now lifted up very high in the spiritual life by this
extraordinary visitation from heaven."
