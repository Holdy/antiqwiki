THE BEES.

The bees understand Welsh; for a woman on the borders of Cardiganshire
and Carmarthenshire informed me that they have a Queen, who leads,
and that they follow, when she bids them to come in these words:--


    "Dewch, Dewch, Dewch."

    (Come, come, come.)


There are many superstitions about bees. There was a custom once of
telling the bees of a death in the family, and they were even put in
mourning. It was once considered by some very lucky to find that a
strange swarm of bees had arrived in the garden or tree; if, however,
they alighted on a dead tree it was an ill omen.
