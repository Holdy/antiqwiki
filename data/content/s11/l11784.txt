DRAWING BLOOD FROM A WITCH.

Drawing blood from a witch by anyone incapacitated the old hag,
from working out her evil designs upon the person who spilt her
blood. Many years ago a farmer from the neighbourhood of Swyddffynon,
in Cardiganshire, was coming home late one night from Tregaron,
on horseback. As he was crossing a bridge called Pont Einon (once
noted for its witches), a witch somehow or other managed to get up
behind him on the horse's back; but he took out his pocket-knife with
which he drew blood from the witch's arm, and he got rid of the old
hag. After this, she was unable to witch people. My informant was
Mr. John Jones, of Pontrhydfendigaid.
