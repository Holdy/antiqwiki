PLANT MAT'S CAVE.

According to tradition "Plant Mat," or "Plant y Fat," were two sons
and a daughter of one Matthew Evans, who kept a public house at
Tregaron in the seventeenth century. These persons became highway
robbers and lived in a cave near Devil's Bridge. The entrance to the
cave admitted only one person at a time and this enabled the robbers
to keep out hundreds when they were attacked. It seems that they had
some notion of honour, for it is said that if either had a friend,
he gave him his glove, which served as a passport when stopped by the
others. They lived for some years in this cave, but at last they were
executed for murder. One of them was captured near Hereford, just
as he was giving out the well-known hail of "Deliver or die." These
robbers are also credited with the attributes of the fairies.
