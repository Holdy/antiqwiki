summary: David Hughes' mother and maid servants heard the voice of the Curate of Lledrod singing outside their house, yet they saw no one around; a year later, David died, and at his funeral, the same Curate sang a hymn. A woman reported hearing a 'Toili' singing three weeks before her aunt's death, and John Llewelyn heard his own voice delivering a funeral sermon outside Rhydwilym Chapel.
