SPIRIT OF A LIVING MAN THROWING STONES.

Mr. Thomas Stephens, an intelligent old man in the neighbourhood of
Mydroilyn, in the Parish of Llanarth, Cardiganshire, informed me that
between 60 and 70 years ago his father, John Stephens, when a young
man, was coming home late one evening after spending a few hours of
pleasant time with the young woman of his affection at a neighbouring
farm. As he was walking along a lonely lane, to his great surprise,
he heard the sound of some one throwing stones about in a field which
he was passing by. When he looked around, he beheld the spirit of a
man of his acquaintance who was well and alive, throwing stones with
all his might in a field where stones were not to be found.

Spirit of a living man was sometimes heard without being seen, of
this I was informed by an old man at Llanddewi Brefi.

In some ghost stories we find the spirits of the departed appearing
to comfort the living.
