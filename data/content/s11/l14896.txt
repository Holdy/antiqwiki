LLYN Y FAN FACH.

This lake is known to all lovers of Welsh Fairy Lore. It lies on the
Black Mountain on the borders of Carmarthenshire and Breconshire. It
has been customary from time immemorial for people from all parts to
throng the banks of this lake on the first day of August to see the
Fairy Lady of the Lake appearing on the surface of the water to comb
her hair. For account of this lady see Fairies in this book.
