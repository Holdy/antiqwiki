ROSEMARY CHARM FOR TOOTHACHE.

Many people still believe that toothache is caused by a worm in the
tooth, and it was once thought that to burn a Rosemary bough until
it becomes black and place it in a strong linen cloth, and anoint
the teeth with it would kill this worm.

According to the old Welsh Magazine, "Y Brython," vol. 3, page 339,
there were many charms performed with Rosemary.

Rosemary dried in the sun and made into powder, tied in a cloth around
the right arm, will make the sick well.

The smoke of Rosemary bark, sniffed, will, even if you are in gaol,
release you.

The leaves made into salve, placed on a wound, where the flesh is dead,
will cure the wound.

A spoon made out of its wood will make whatever you eat therewith
nutritious.

Place it under the door post and no snake nor adder can ever enter
thy house.

The leaves placed in beer or wine will keep these liquids from becoming
sour and give such a flavour that you will dispose of them quickly.

Place a branch of rosemary on the barrel and it will keep thee from
fever, even though thou drink of it for a whole day.



"SLIME" OF TROUT AS MEDICINE.

In West Wales once a freshly caught trout was placed in a pan of milk
in which it would swim, and after it was supposed that the fish had
passed the milk through its gills and left some of its slime in the
milk, the milk was supposed to have been given the necessary medicinal
powers for the cure of whooping cough and other illness.
