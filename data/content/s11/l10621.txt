THE MOON.

There are still lingering in Wales many beliefs and practices with
respect to the moon. It is considered unlucky to see the new moon the
first time through the window, and many persons go out of doors to see
her and show her a piece of money to insure good luck while that moon
lasts. I was told by an old gentleman in Cardiganshire that he had seen
many taking off their hats and bowing to the new moon; some ladies
also make a curtsey to her, and it is considered very lucky to see
her over the right shoulder. If a person wishes anything when he sees
the new moon after New Year's Day, his wish will be granted to him.

Putting a Hen to Sit.--A hen is put to sit so as to get the chick
out of the egg at the waxing, and not at the waning of the moon,
as it is believed that the young birds are strong or weak according
to the age of the moon when they are hatched.

Sowing.--There are still many people who are very particular to sow
their seeds in their gardens and their fields during the first quarter
of the moon, owing to the idea that the seed will then germinate
quicker, and grow stronger than when the moon is on the wane. I knew
a farmer--a native of Llanfynydd, in Carmarthenshire--who was always
very careful to sow his wheat during the first quarter or the waxing
of the moon, and it is a well-known fact that he had always a good
crop at harvest time.

There are also people who are very particular about having their
hair cut just before or about full moon so that it might grow better
afterwards.

When a child, I was told that the dark object which is to be seen in
the moon is a man who was taken up there as a punishment for gathering
firewood on the Sabbath Day.
