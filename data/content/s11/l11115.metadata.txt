summary: The Welsh myth of the Gwiber describes it as a dragon-like, flying serpent with dangerous tendencies, a creature believed to emerge when snakes drank human milk, prevalent in southern Cardiganshire. A notable tale recalls a Gwiber that haunted Talybont's rocky cliffs and another in Trelech, Carmarthenshire, both eventually vanquished by local residents.
