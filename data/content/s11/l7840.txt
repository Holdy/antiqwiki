THE SPIRIT OF A LIVING MAN APPEARING TO A LITTLE GIRL AT PONTSHAN.

An old lady named Miss Pergrin, who lives at Pontshan, Llandyssul,
informed me about five years ago, that when she was a little girl
of about eleven years of age, a certain man who lived in that
neighbourhood had gone from home, for some months, and just about
the time when he was expected to return the little girl was one day
walking along the road near the village, about two o'clock in the
afternoon. She suddenly met the man coming home. He was coming along
the road towards her, and looked at her, and then suddenly disappeared
through a gate into an adjoining field. She was very much surprised,
as the man was not expected home till next day. The next moment two
sisters of the man appeared on the scene, and the girl informed them
that she had just seen their brother, and inquired whether they had
met him as they passed along the same road about the same time. But
they in reply positively affirmed that they had seen no sight of him
on the road or anywhere else since he left home, and that the girl
must have been dreaming or inventing some idle tale, for their brother
was not returning home till to-morrow. About 2 p.m., the next day,
the man did come home, and, strange to say, it was found out that
the day Miss Pergrin had seen him, he was far away from the district,
so it was concluded that she had seen his spirit, and that in broad
daylight. Miss Pergrin did not like to give the man's name.
