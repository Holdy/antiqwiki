summary: John Newton, buried in Montgomery's churchyard after being condemned for highway robbery, predicted that grass would not grow on his grave as proof of his innocence; his prophecy came true as the plot remains barren to this day. A curse seems to follow those connected to his grave, as one accuser became a drunkard and another died mysteriously, enhancing the tale's notoriety and leading to local lore about the cursed spot.
