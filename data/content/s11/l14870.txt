LLYN LLECHWEN.

Llyn Llechwen, or Llyn Llech Owen, lies on the top of a hill near
Gorslas, in Carmarthenshire. According to a local tradition there
was only a small well once on the spot now occupied by the lake. The
well had a stone cover which had to be removed by those who came to
obtain water, and to be carefully replaced after obtaining it. But
once upon a time a certain farmer in the neighbourhood sent a boy
almost every day to the well to water his horse. Whenever the boy
returned the farmer always asked him, "Did you put back the stone
over the mouth of the well, my boy?" The boy answered "Yes." One
day, however, when in a hurry, the lad quite forgot about replacing
the stone, and the consequence was that the water of the well burst
forth till it formed a lake. The above story was told me by an old
man named John Jones, who lives in the small town of Llangadock,
who added that he had heard it from his mother when a boy.

According to another tale respecting the spot, it was one famous
warrior known as Owen Lawgoch, and his men, who forgot to replace the
cover; but when he found the water bursting forth both he and his men
entered a cave in alarm, and fell asleep which is to last till it is
broken by the sound of a trumpet and the clang of arms on Rhiw Goch,
then to sally forth to conquer.
