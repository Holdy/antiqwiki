GWRACH Y RHIBYN.

Gwrach y Rhibyn was an ugly old hag with long flowing hair, glaring
eyes and face as gloomy as death itself. The shriek of the old hag
was supposed to foretell a death or some misfortune. She appeared,
as a rule, only before the death of a person who had lived a wicked
life; at least this is the saying in West Wales, especially in
Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire.
