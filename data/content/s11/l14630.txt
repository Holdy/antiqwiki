HOLY WELL AT LLANGYBI.

Llangybi is about four miles from Lampeter, in Cardiganshire. The
Vicar, the Rev. J. N. Evans, informed me that there is a well in
this parish known as "Ffynon wen," formerly supposed to possess
healing powers; and that there is a tradition in the neighbourhood
that St. Gybi himself lived at a house which is still called "Llety
Cybi." Mr. Evans also adds in the Transactions of the Cardiganshire
Antiquarian Society, Vol I., that within a quarter-of-a-mile of the
Holy Well, there used to be a large stone called "Llech Gybi," which
the invalids who came to this well for healing were required to touch.

There is a Holy Well of St. Gybi in Carnarvonshire also, to which
it was once customary for young women to travel long distances,
in order to find out their lover's intentions at the forthcoming
fair. A pocket handkerchief was thrown on the surface of the water,
and "if it floated to the South there would be great joy and delight,
but if to the North, the girl would be an old maid."
