FAIRIES PLAYING TRICKS WITH THE OVEN.

Miss Evelyn Lewes, Tyglyn Aeron, in the "Carmarthenshire Antiquities"
says, "Should the dough not rise properly, but present a stringy
appearance, the Cardiganshire housewife announces that "Mae bara
yn robin," and forthwith orders the sacrifice of an old slipper,
presumably to propitiate the fairy folk who are inclined to play
tricks with the oven.... A native of Montgomeryshire tells me that
in her youth no loaf at her home was ever placed in the oven unless
a cross had been previously signed upon it."
