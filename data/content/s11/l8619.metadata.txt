summary: According to local legend around Llanfihangel Geneu'r Glyn, a church was initially attempted to be built at Glanfread but each night's work was undone by a spirit, instructing that it should instead be at its current location, Genau'r Glyn. The location's history includes connections to Edward Llwyd, a noted author, and the belief that it derived its name from a devout woman, St. Fraed, believed to have intended to build a church there.
