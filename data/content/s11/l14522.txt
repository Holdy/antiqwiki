THE LLANCYNVELYN WELL.

The parish of Llancynvelyn is situated on high ground which juts
out into the bog called Gors Fochno not far from Borth, in North
Cardiganshire. Cynvelyn, to whom the Church is dedicated, was a Welsh
Saint, descended from Cunedda. Within the memory of many people who are
now alive, there was a holy well in the Churchyard of Llancynvelyn,
and the sexton, an intelligent old man, informed me a few years ago,
that its water was thought to possess health-restoring qualities,
and he himself noticed people resorting there to bathe their feet in
the well; and some came with bottles and carried some of the water
home with them as a household remedy.



CANNA'S WELL (CARMARTHENSHIRE).

The parish of Llangan is not far from Whitland. The holy well there,
known as Canna's Well, was much resorted to in former times, as its
water was supposed to cure ague and intestinal complaints. After
throwing a pin into the well, and drink of the water or bathe in
it, it was customary for the patient to sit down in "Canna's Chair"
for a certain length of time and try to sleep. "Canna's Chair" is a
stone. In former times the superstitious believed it had a peculiar
virtue in connection with the well.
