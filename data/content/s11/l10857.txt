THE SWALLOW--Y WENNOL.

Many superstitions which cluster round the Swallow, have descended to
us from remote antiquity; and among the Romans this bird was sacred to
the household gods and the family. In Wales, it was formerly believed
that the swallow, like the cuckoo, slept through the winter. This
bird is also supposed to bring good fortune to the house upon which
it builds its nest. If, however, the bird forsakes its old nest on a
house, it is considered a sign of ill-luck. It is also most unlucky
to break a swallow's nest.


   "Y neb a doro nyth y wenol
    Ni wel fwyniant yn dragwyddol."

    (Whoever breaks a swallow's nest,
    Never, never shall be blest.)
