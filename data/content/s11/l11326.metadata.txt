summary: A young woman in Llanllawddog fell gravely ill due to a supposed Gypsy curse, but recovered instantly after a local wizard instructed her mother to place a charmed folded paper on her chest. The wizard revealed the curse and warned the woman to avoid Gypsies; years later, the paper's inscription was found to be a simple incantation: 'Abracadabra, Sickness depart from me.'
