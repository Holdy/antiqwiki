WITCHES SELLING THEMSELVES TO THE DEVIL.

In order to become witches it was believed in Cardiganshire that
some old women sold themselves to the Father of Lies by giving to
His Satanic Majesty the bread of the Communion. The following story
I heard about three years ago, and my informant was Mr. John Davies,
Gogoyan Farm, a, farmer who had heard it from old people:--

Sometime in the beginning of the last century, two old dames attended
the morning service at Llanddewi Brefi Church, and partook of the
Holy Communion; but instead of eating the sacred bread like other
communicants, they kept it in their mouths and went out. Then they
walked round the Church outside nine times, and at the ninth time
the Evil One came out from the Church wall in the form of a frog, to
whom they gave the bread from their mouths, and by doing this wicked
thing they were supposed to be selling themselves to Satan and become
witches. It was also added that after this they were sometimes seen
swimming in the river Teivi in form of hares!

According to Cadrawd, there was an old man in North Pembrokeshire, who
used to say that he obtained the power of bewitching in the following
manner:--The bread of his first Communion he pocketed. He made pretence
at eating it first of all, and then put it in his pocket. When he
went out from the service there was a dog meeting him by the gate,
to which he gave the bread, thus selling his soul to the Devil. Ever
after, he possessed the power to bewitch.
