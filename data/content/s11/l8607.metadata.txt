summary: Llangeler Church, located in Carmarthenshire near the Cardiganshire border, was originally intended to be built in an area called "Parc-y-Bwci." However, local tradition states that construction efforts were mysteriously moved overnight to the present location without explaining the involvement of spirits, despite "Parc-y-Bwci" meaning Goblin's Park.
