FOR PAIN IN THE EYE.

"Seek the gall of a hare, of a hen, of a eel, and of a stag, with
fresh urine and honeysuckle leaves, then inflict a wound upon an ivy
tree, and mix the gum that exudes from the wound therewith, boiling
it swiftly, and straining it through a fine linen cloth; when cold,
insert a little thereof in the corners of the eyes, and it will be a
wonder if he who makes use of it does not see the stars in mid-day,
in consequence of the virtues of this remedy."--Physicians of Myddfai.
