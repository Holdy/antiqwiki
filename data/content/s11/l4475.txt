FAIRY NAMES.

The Fairies are spoken of as people, or folk, not as myths or goblins,
and yet as spirits they are immortal, and able to make themselves
invisible.

The most general name given them in Wales is "Y Tylwyth Teg," (the
Fair Family, or Folk); but they are known sometimes as "Bendith
y Mamau" (the Mothers' Blessing); and the term "gwragedd Annwn,"
(dames of the lower regions), is often applied to the Fairy Ladies
who dwelt in lakes or under lakes. Sometimes such terms as "Plant
Annwn," (children of the lower regions); Ellyll an elf; Bwbach etc.,
were applied to them, but such appellations have never been in common
use. They were also known as "Plant Rhys Ddwfn" in some parts of the
Vale of Teivy, more especially in the neighbourhood of Cardigan. But
the general term Tylwyth Teg, is known everywhere.
