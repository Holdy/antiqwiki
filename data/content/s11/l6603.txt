FAIRY MONEY.

An old man named Evan Morris, Goginan, informed me that a farmer
in the Vale of Rheidol one day found a sixpence on the top of a
gate-post. On the next day he found a shilling there, and on the day
after two shillings, the sum was doubled every day till the man was
beginning to get rich. At last, however, the farmer told his family or
his friends about his good luck, and after this he got no more money,
as the Fairies were offended that he did not keep the thing secret.
