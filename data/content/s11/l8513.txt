SPIRITS REMOVING CHURCHES.

There are several legends in West and Mid-Wales, especially in
Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire, in which spirits or some other
mysterious powers, play a prominent part in the removal of Churches
from one site to another.



LLANDDEUSANT (CARMARTHENSHIRE).

I am indebted for the following to the Rev. H. M. Williams, Vicar
of Lledrod:--

There is a tradition in the parish of Llanddeusant, that the parish
church was to have been built at first at Twynllanan, in the centre
of the parish; but the stones that were put up during the day were
removed in the night, to the spot where the church now stands.



LLANBISTER CHURCH (RADNORSHIRE).

The Rev. Professor Tyrrell Green, St. David's College, Lampeter,
writes to me thus:--

"Jonathan Williams in his History of Radnorshire, p. 194, ed., 1859,
says that near Llanbister Church is a piece of land on which it
was originally intended to have erected the Church, but tradition
reports that the accomplishment of this design was prevented by
the intervention of supernatural agency. "The tradition that a
supernatural being carried away in the night whatever was built of
the church during the day, is still kept alive, because the warden
claims an annual rent of 2s. 6d. for the vacant and unconsecrated
site of the originally intended church." In the same book mention is
made of an old custom prevailing in this parish, viz., the payment
of a certain tax or tribute called "Clwt-y-Gyllell," or Knife Money,
imposed on a certain corner of a field on some estates, consisting
of a certain number of groats.
