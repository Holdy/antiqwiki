THE TOLLING OF BLAENPORTH CHURCH BELL BEFORE A DEATH.

Several old persons living in the parish of Blaenporth, South
Cardiganshire, informed me that it is a fact that in former times
a death in certain families in that parish was always foretold by
the church-bell in the steeple tolling three times at the hour of
midnight unrung by human hands. One old woman gave me the following
tradition concerning the origin of this tolling:--

Once upon a time a spirit came at midnight and knocked at the door
of a farmhouse known as Tan-yr-Eglwys, which is close to Blaenporth
Church. "Who is there?" enquired the farmer from his bed. "Mair Wen
(white Mary) of Blaenporth," was the reply; "the silver communion
cup has been stolen from the church." Then the spirit begged the
farmer to get up from bed and proceed at once on a journey to the
town of Cardigan, as the man who had committed such sacrilegious
act was resting that night on a sofa in a certain public house in
that town with the silver cup under his waistcoat. The farmer went
to Cardigan, and when he arrived at the public house named by the
spirit, and entered a certain room, a strange man who was lying on
the sofa got up, and the stolen cup from under his waistcoat fell
to the floor. The farmer took it up in an instant, and returned with
all speed to Blaenporth, and placed the sacred vessel in the church
once more. For his kindness and trouble in thus restoring the sacred
cup, the good spirit or guardian angel of Blaenporth Church told
the farmer that the bell would toll three times before his death,
and before the death of his descendants till the ninth generation.
