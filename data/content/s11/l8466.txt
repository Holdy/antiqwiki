A SPIRIT IN A RIVER.

Near Llandyssul, in Cardiganshire, and the borders of Carmarthenshire,
there is a pool in the River Teivi, known as the "Pool of the
Harper." When I visited the village a few years ago I was told that
it is said that an old harper was drowned there long ago; and that
it is still believed by some that on a fine summer afternoon, one
hears his spirit playing his harp in the pool.
