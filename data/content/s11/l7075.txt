THE MERMAID AND THE FISHERMEN.

Mr. Lewis, Henbant, an old man who lives in the neighbourhood of
Llanarth, Cardiganshire, told me the following tale five years ago,
though I am indebted for some particulars to the Rev. D. Lewis, Vicar
of Llansantffread:--In times gone by a mermaid was often seen on a
rock known as Careg Ina, near New Quay. One day this sea creature
became entangled in the nets of some fishermen who were out fishing
some considerable distance from the land. She entreated the men to
disentangle her, and allow her to return to the water. Her request was
granted, and in gratitude the mermaid warned them of a coming storm,
and advised them to make for the shore without delay. This they did
hurriedly, and as they were nearing the land a terrific storm came
on suddenly, and it was with difficulty that they managed to land
safely. Other fishermen in another boat on the very same day, not
having the advantage of being warned by the mermaid, were caught by
the storm and met with a watery grave.

I have also discovered a version of this story at Aberporth, a seaside
village some distance to the South of New Quay.

It was formerly believed that there were mermen as well as mermaids,
though I have no Welsh tale of a merman.
