THE BEES AND ST. DAVID.

"Modomnoc, a disciple of St. David, went to Ireland, and a large
swarm of bees followed him, and settled on the prow of the ship
where he sat. They supplied him with meat during his Irish Mission;
but he, not wishing to enjoy their company by fraud, brought them
back to Wales, when they fled to their usual place, and David blessed
Modomnoc for his humility. Three times the bees went and returned,
and the third time holy David dismissed Modomnoc with the bees, and
blessed them, saying that henceforth bees should prosper in Ireland,
and should no longer increase in Glyn Rosyn. 'This,' adds Rhyddmarch,
'is found to be the fact: swarms forthwith decreased at David's;
but Ireland, in which, until that time, bees could never live, is
now enriched with plenty of honey. It is manifested that they could
not live there before; for if you throw Irish earth or stone into
the midst of the bees, they disperse, and, flying, they will shun
it.'--"Pilgrimage to St. David's."
