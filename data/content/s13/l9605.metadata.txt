summary: Opaleeta, a chief of the Chatas tribe, was revived after drowning in Bayou Lacombe, Louisiana, and lamented his revival because he had glimpsed the idyllic Under Land, a paradise where souls thrived in eternal joy and harmony. Opaleeta's story was kept secret among the chiefs to prevent despair-driven suicides among the tribe, yet he carried his longing for the Under Land until his death, when he finally embraced it.
