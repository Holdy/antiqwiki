summary: The young Atotarho, unlike his fierce father, demonstrated his peaceful nature and mighty strength by lifting the massive 480-ton Balanced Rock, astonishing a group of boys who mocked his delicate appearance. He used this act to impart a lesson on humility and respect, and the tale was recounted by the tribe's elders for years to come.
