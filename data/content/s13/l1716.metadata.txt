summary: Joseph Smith, in Palmyra, New York, claimed to have received divine guidance to the golden plates, which he translated into the Book of Mormon, forming the basis of a new religious movement despite its novel-based origins. After Smith's death, Brigham Young led the followers to Utah, while the inception of spiritualism in Hydesville, New York, marked the area as a fertile ground for new religious ideas.
