summary: In 1779, after a campaign against the Indians, General Sullivan ordered his troops to kill and leave behind superfluous horses near what is now known as Horseheads, New York, resulting in heaps of horse skulls discovered by later settlers. These settlers named their village Horseheads in reference to these skull monuments, honoring a historic moment in the area's past.
