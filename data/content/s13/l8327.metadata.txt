summary: In Moodus, Connecticut, mysterious noises have been reported since the early 1700s, attributed by locals to everything from subterranean movements to witchcraft battles beneath Mount Tom. Dr. Steele, an Englishman, attempted to seize a powerful gem believed to cause these noises, but his endeavor ended disastrously, with the gem reportedly sinking his ship in mid-ocean, though its eerie glow persists beneath the waters.
