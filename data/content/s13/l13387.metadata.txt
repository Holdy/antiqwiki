summary: In the mystical valley of Yo Semite, Chief Tutokanula became enraptured with the spirit Tisayac, neglecting his tribe as he pined for her presence. Ultimately, as the valley was restored by Tisayac's plea to the Great Spirit, Tutokanula reunited with the spirit by leaping into the Bridal Veil waterfall, disappearing into legend.
