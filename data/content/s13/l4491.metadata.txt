summary: The town of Orrington, Maine, was established by Jesse Atwood in 1778 and became a community noted for its skilled farmers and brave sailors. The town was named due to a spelling error by a township clerk, who intended to name it Orangetown after a Maryland village, but accidentally recorded it as Orrington.
