summary: The serene Creve Cœur Lake near St. Louis is said to have the power to strengthen love and reconcile estranged lovers, a magic attributed to a historic battle where a warrior couple renewed their vows by its shores. Another tale suggests that the lake's mystical aura stems from a demon-fish inhabited by the spirit of an Ozark princess, cursed to punish unfaithful lovers after her heart was broken by a Spanish governor's son.
