summary: On White Island, a pirate's mistress kept a promise to guard buried treasure after her lover perished in a naval confrontation that resulted in the destruction of his ship and an attacking man-of-war. The woman's ghost is said to haunt the rocky shores, eternally keeping watch as a spectral sentinel, her figure visible at night with her golden hair cascading over her shoulders.
