summary: Swunksus, the original proprietor of Deer Isle, agreed to share his land with a white renegade named Conary, but their peaceful coexistence was disrupted due to Conary's insatiable greed and quarrelsome nature. Ultimately, Conary killed Swunksus while he was in a drunken stupor, claiming the island for himself, though Swunksus's spirit is said to still haunt the area with ghostly snores echoing through the woods.
