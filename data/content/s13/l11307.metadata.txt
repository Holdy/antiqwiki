summary: In the rough justice of the Old West, a vigilance committee formed to hang a gang of horse-thieves along Cedar River, Iowa, including a man who was believed to be falsely accused. A lightning strike saved the accused man moments before his execution, allowing him to prove his innocence and resulting in his release, while serving as a stark warning to others about the company they keep.
