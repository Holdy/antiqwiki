The medicinal properties of the mineral springs at Ballston and Saratoga
were familiar to the Indians, and High Rock Spring, to which Sir William
Johnson was carried by the Mohawks in 1767 to be cured of a wound, was
called “the medicine spring of the Great Spirit,” for it was believed
that the leaping and bubbling of the water came from its agitation by
hands not human, and red men regarded it with reverence.
