summary: Above Georgetown on the Potomac River, three rocks known as the Three Sisters are believed to moan before river deaths, following the drowning of three sisters at the site over a century ago. In May 1889, the eerie moans were heard again, foretelling the tragic drowning of a young rower whose boat capsized near the rocks.
