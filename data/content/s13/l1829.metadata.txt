summary: In a cellar in Schenectady, a mysterious human silhouette in mould repeatedly appeared on the floor, leading locals to suspect it was a spirit marking its grave from an old burial ground or the result of foul play. Some believed it to be a vampire's outline, unable to leave its grave due to a powerful spell, with historical tales of vampire heart-burnings contributing to the lore, but eventually the mould stopped appearing.
