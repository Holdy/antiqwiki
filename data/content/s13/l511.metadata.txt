summary: In the Catskill Mountains, near the New Grand Hotel, mythical beings known as pygmies were said to forge metals, dance on precipices, and brew a magical liquor that deformed those who drank it. When Hudson and his crew visited, they were affected by the pygmiesâ€™ potent drink, an encounter later witnessed by Rip Van Winkle before his legendary sleep.
