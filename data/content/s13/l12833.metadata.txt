summary: A hunter in Dead Man's Canon was pursued by hostiles and found unexpected help from a spider that lowered a silken cord from a sandstone spire, allowing him to climb to safety. The hunter stayed at the summit, surviving on dew and eagles' eggs, until the attackers left, and then safely descended by the cord, leading to the spire being named the Spider Tower.
