summary: In 1765, a baneful omen appeared in an Indian village near present-day Oxford, Alabama, when two mothers simultaneously gave birth to leopard-spotted children, leading to accusations of witchcraft and resulting plans for execution by fire. As the entire tribe gathered, the earth suddenly opened up in a catastrophic earthquake, swallowing nearly everyone except two braves, and later forming the body of water known as Blue Pond.
