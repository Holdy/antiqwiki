summary: During the harsh winter at Valley Forge, two soldiers were ambushed by Tory farmers while foraging, leading one, Arthur L. Carrington, to become trapped in a cave by a massive falling rock. Unable to be rescued, Carrington starved to death; his remains, found years later, included a message of love to his sweetheart, who had died of a broken heart soon after hearing of his plight.
