      In his view the lively dream sets
        Hills and vales in verdure bright;
      Where the gaily-prattling streamlets
        Sparkle in the morning-light.

      Hark! the holy bell is swinging,
        Calling to the house of prayer;
      Loud resounds the solemn ringing
        Through the still and balmy air.

      Youths and maids from glen and mountain
        Hasten at the hallowed sound,
      Old men rest by shady fountain,
        Children lay them on the ground.

      Now the pious throng is streaming
        Through the temple's portal low;
      Rapture in each face is beaming
        Pure devotion's genuine glow.

      Fervently the hoary pastor,
        Humbly bent before his God,
      Supplicates their heavenly Master
        Them to lead on Sion's road;

      Owns that all have widely erred
        From the true, the narrow way,
      That with Him we have no merit,
        And no claim of right can lay.

      Loud then rise in choral measure
        Hymns of gratitude and praise,
      As, inspired with solemn pleasure,
        Unto Heaven their strains they raise.

      Now the grave discourse beginneth,
        Which, ungraced by rhetoric's arts,
      Quick the rapt attention winneth,
        While it glorious truths imparts;

      While it tells how kind is Heaven
        To the race of him who fell;
      How of old the Son was given
        To redeem from pains of hell;

      How the Holy Spirit abideth
        In their hearts that hear his call;
      How our God for all provideth,
        How His mercy's over all;

      How, beyond the grave extending,
        Regions lie of endless bliss;
      How our thoughts on that world bending,
        We should careless be of this.

      Once again the raised hymn pealeth
        Notes of joy and jubilee,
      Praising Him who truth revealeth,
        Dweller of Eternity!
