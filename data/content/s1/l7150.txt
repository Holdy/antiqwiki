                               FEROES.

      Sjûrur touk teâ besta svör
      Sum Dvörgurin heji smuja.
                      QVÖRFINS THAATTUR.

      Sigurd took the very best sword
      That the Dwarfs had ever smithed.


The people of the Feroes believe in the same classes of beings as the
inhabitants of the countries whence their ancestors came.

They call the Trolls Underground-people, Hollow-men, Foddenskkmænd,
and Huldefolk. These Trolls used frequently to carry people into their
hills, and detain them there. Among several other instances,
Debes[224] gives the following one of this practice:

"Whilst Mr. Taale was priest in Osteröe, it happened that one of his
hearers was carried away and returned again. At last the said young man
being to be married, and every thing prepared, and the priest being
arrived the Saturday before at the parish, the bridegroom was carried
away; wherefore they sent folks to look after him, but he could not be
found. The priest desired his friends to have good courage, and that he
would come again; which he did at last, and related that the spirit that
led him away was in the shape of a most beautiful woman, and very richly
dressed, who desired him to forsake her whom he was now to marry, and
consider how ugly his mistress was in comparison of her, and what fine
apparel she had. He said also that he saw the men that sought after him,
and that they went close by him but could not see him, and that he heard
their calling, and yet could not answer them; but that when he would not
be persuaded he was again left at liberty."
