summary: Dwarfs in Jüne near Göttingen used invisible caps to steal corn until a farmer devised a plan to catch them and received a peck of money by retrieving it before sunrise, thanks to a friend's advice on timing. Similarly, another farmer trapped a dwarf and was promised a waggon-load of money, but found only a dead horse, which turned into pure gold on his return home.
