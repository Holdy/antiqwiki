                                                            GOLDING.

Golding seems to have regarded, by chance or with knowledge, the Elves
as a higher species than the Fairies. Misled by the word _elves_,
Shakspeare makes sad confusion of classic and Gothic mythology.

[399] _Take_ signifies here, to strike, to injure.

      And there he blasts the tree and _takes_ the cattle.
                                       _Merry Wives of Windsor_, iv. 4.

      Thou farest as fruit that with the frost is taken.
                                   SURREY, _Poems_, p. 13, Ald. edit.

In our old poetry _take_ also signifies, to give.

[400]

      But not a word of it,--'tis fairies' treasure,
      Which but revealed brings on the blabber's ruin.
                          MASSINGER, _Fatal Dowry_, Act iv. sc. 1.

      A prince's secrets are like fairy favours,
      Wholesome if kept, but poison if discovered.
