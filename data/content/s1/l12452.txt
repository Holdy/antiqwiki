                          _Pixy-Gratitude._

An old woman who lived near Tavistock had in her garden a splendid bed
of tulips. To these the Pixies of the neighbourhood loved to resort,
and often at midnight might they be heard singing their babes to rest
among them. By their magic power they made the tulips more beautiful
and more permanent than any other tulips, and they caused them to emit
a fragrance equal to that of the rose. The old woman was so fond of
her tulips that she would never let one of them be plucked, and thus
the Pixies were never deprived of their floral bowers.

But at length the old woman died; the tulips were taken up, and the
place converted into a parsley-bed. Again, however, the power of the
Pixies was shown; the parsley withered, and nothing would grow even in
the other beds of the garden. On the other hand, they tended diligently
the grave of the old woman, around which they were heard lamenting and
singing dirges. They suffered not a weed to grow on it; they kept it
always green, and evermore in spring-time spangled with wild flowers.
