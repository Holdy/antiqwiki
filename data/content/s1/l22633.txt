      Night's dim shades were now retreating,
        Over Andes rose the day,
      On the hills the kids' loud bleating
        Lingering slumber chased away.

      Birds their merry notes were singing,
        Joyous at the approach of morn--
      Morn that, light and fragrance flinging,
        Earth doth cherish and adorn.

      Waked by Nature's general chorus
        Selkirk quits his lonely couch,
      While o'er heaven run colours glorious,
        Heralding the sun's approach.

      Still the vision hovers o'er him,
        Still the heavenly strains he hears,
      Setting those bright realms before him
        Where are wiped away all tears.

      All this vain and transitory
        State of mankind here on earth,
      Weighed with that exceeding glory,
        Now he deems as nothing worth.

      Low he bends in adoration,
        As the sun ascends the sky;
      Doubt and fear and lamentation
        With the night's last shadows fly.
