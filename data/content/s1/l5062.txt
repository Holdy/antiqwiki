                      _A Farmer tricks a Troll._

A farmer, on whose ground there was a little hill, resolved not to let
it lie idle, so he began at one end to plough it up. The hill-man, who
lived in it, came to him and asked him how he dared to plough on the
roof of his house. The farmer assured him that he did not know that it
was the roof of his house, but at the same time represented to him
that it was at present equally unprofitable to them both to let such a
piece of land lie idle. He therefore took the opportunity of proposing
to him that he should plough, sow, and reap it every year on these
terms: that they should take it year and year about, and the hill-man
to have one year what grew over the ground, and the farmer what grew
in the ground; and the next year the farmer to have what was over, and
the hill-man what was under.

The agreement was made accordingly; but the crafty farmer took care to
sow carrots and corn year and year about, and he gave the hill-man the
tops of the carrots and the roots of the corn for his share, with
which he was well content. They thus lived for a long time on
extremely good terms with each other.[176]
