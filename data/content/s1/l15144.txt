FOOTNOTES:

[415] Mr. Cromek. There was, we believe, some false dealing on the
part of Allan Cunningham toward this gentleman, such as palming on him
his own verses as traditionary ones. But the legends are genuine.

[416] This answers to the _Deenè Mâh_, Good People, of the Highlands
and Ireland. An old Scottish name, we may add, for a fairy seems to
have been Bogle, akin to the English Pouke, Puck, Puckle; but
differing from the Boggart. Thus Gawain Douglas says,

      Of _Brownyis_ and of _Boggles_ full is this Beuk.

[418] These elf-arrows are triangular pieces of flint, supposed to have
been the heads of the arrows used by the aborigines. Though more
plentiful in Scotland they are also found in England and Ireland, and
were there also attached to the fairies, and the wounds were also only
to be discerned by gifted eyes. In an Anglo-Saxon poem, there occur the
words [Old English: æsa gescot] and [Old English: ýlfa gescot], _i. e._
arrow of the Gods, and arrow of the Elves. Grimm, Deut. Mythol., p. 22.

[419] "It was till lately believed by the ploughmen of Clydesdale,
that if they repeated the rhyme

      Fairy, fairy, bake me a bannock and roast me a collop,
      And I'll gie ye a spurtle off my gadend!

three several times on turning their cattle at the terminations of
ridges, they would find the said fare prepared for them on reaching the
end of the fourth furrow."--Chambers' Popular Rhymes of Scotland, p. 33.

[420] See above, pp. 302, 311. Graham also relates this legend in his
Picturesque Sketches of Perthshire.

[421] Hugh Miller, The Old Red Sandstone, p. 251. We are happy to have
an opportunity of expressing the high feelings of respect and esteem
which we entertain for this extraordinary man. Born in the lowest rank
of society, and commencing life as a workman in a stone-quarry, he
has, by the mere force of natural genius, become not only a most able
geologist but an elegant writer, and a sound and discerning critic.
Scotland seems to stand alone in producing such men.

[422] He is named as we have seen (p. 351) by Gawain Douglas. King
James says of him "The spirit called Brownie appeared like a rough
man, and haunted divers houses without doing any evill, but doing, as
it were, necessarie turns up and down the house; yet some are so
blinded as to believe that their house was all the sonsier, as they
called it, that such spirits resorted there."

[423] Popular Rhymes of Scotland, p. 33.

[424] Grimm (Deut. Mythol., p. 479) says it is the German Schellenrock,
_i. e._, Bell-coat, from his coat being hung with bells like those of
the fools. A _Puck_ he says, once served in a convent in Mecklenburg,
for thirty years, in kitchen, and stable, and the only reward he asked
was "tunicam de diversis coloribus et _tintinnabulis_ plenam."

[426] In what precedes, we have chiefly followed Mr. Cromek. Those
anxious for further information will meet it in the Minstrelsy of the
Scottish Border, and other works.
