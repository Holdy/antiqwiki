summary: Gitto Bach, a boy who often played on the mountain, disappeared for two years and returned believing he had only been away for a day, telling tales of dancing with little children who gave him clothes made of white paper. Another tale shared was of a narrator using a four-leaved clover to see fairies dancing on Craig y Dinis, and an old man who claimed to see fairies near waterfalls in the Vale of Neath.
