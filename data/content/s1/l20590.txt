FOOTNOTES:

[585] The Pang (Span. _pa√±o_, cloth) is an oblong piece of cotton cloth,
which the natives manufacture and wear wrapped round their bodies.

[586] For the preceding account of the Yumboes we are indebted to a
young lady, who spent several years of her childhood at Gorce. What
she related to us she had heard from her maid, a Jaloff woman, who
spoke no language but Jaloff.
