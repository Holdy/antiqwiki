                  _Dorylas with a bevy of Fairies._

        _Dor._ How like you now, my Grace? Is not my countenance
      Royal and full of majesty? Walk not I
      Like the young prince of pygmies? Ha, my knaves,
      We'll fill our pockets. Look, look yonder, elves;
      Would not yon apples tempt a better conscience
      Than any we have, to rob an orchard? Ha!
      Fairies, like nymphs with child, must have the things
      They long for. You sing here a fairy catch
      In that strange tongue I taught you, while ourself
      Do climb the trees. Thus princely Oberon
      Ascends his throne of state.

        _Elves._   Nos beata Fauni proles,
                        Quibus non est magna moles,
                        Quamvis Lunam incolamus.
                        Hortos sæpe frequentamus.

                        Furto cuncta magis bella,
                        Furto dulcior puella,
                        Furto omnia decora,
                        Furto poma dulciora.

                        Cum mortales lecto jacent,
                        Nobis poma noctu placent;
                        Illa tamen sunt ingrata
                        Nisi furto sint parata.

Jocastus and his man Bromius come upon the Elves while plundering the
orchard: the latter is for employing his cudgel on the occasion, but
Jocastus is overwhelmed by the condescension of the princely Oberon in
coming to his orchard, when

      His Grace had orchards of his own more precious
      Than mortals can have any.

The Elves, by his master's permission, pinch Bromius, singing,

      Quoniam per te violamur,
      Ungues hic experiamur;
      Statim dices tibi datam
      Cutem valde variatam.

Finally, when the coast is clear, Oberon cries,

      So we are got clean off; come, noble peers
      Of Fairy, come, attend our royal Grace.
      Let's go and share our fruit with our queen Mab
      And the other dairy-maids; where of this theme
      We will discourse amidst our cakes and cream.

               Cum tot poma habeamus,
               Triumphos læti jam canamus;
               Faunos ego credam ortos,
               Tantum ut frequentent hortos.

               I domum, Oberon, ad illas,
               Quæ nos manent nunc, ancillas,
               Quarum osculemur sinum,
               Inter poma lac et vinum.

In the old play of Fuimus Troes are the following lines:[404]

      Fairies small,
      Two foot tall,
      With caps red
      On their head,
      Danse around
      On the ground.

The pastoral poets also employed the Fairy Mythology. Had they used it
exclusively, giving up the Nymphs, Satyrs, and all the rural rout of
antiquity, and joined with it faithful pictures of the scenery England
then presented, with just delineations of the manners and character of
the peasantry, the pastoral poetry of that age would have been as
unrivalled as its drama. But a blind admiration of classic models, and
a fondness for allegory, were the besetting sins of the poets. They
have, however, left a few gems in this way.

Britannia's Pastorals furnish the following passages:[405]

      Near to this wood there lay a pleasant mead,
      Where fairies often did their measures tread,
      Which in the meadows made such circles green,
      As if with garlands it had crowned been;
      Or like the circle where the signs we track,
      And learned shepherds call 't the Zodiac;
      Within one of these rounds was to be seen
      A hillock rise, where oft the fairy-queen
      At twilight sate, and did command her elves
      To pinch those maids that had not swept their shelves;
      And, further, if, by maiden's oversight,
      Within doors water was not brought at night,
      Or if they spread no table, set no bread,
      They should have nips from toe unto the head;
      And for the maid who had perform'd each thing,
      She in the water-pail bade leave a ring.
