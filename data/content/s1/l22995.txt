          Oh! 'tis eggs are a treat,
          When so white and so sweet
      From under the manger they're taken,
          And by fair Margery,
          Och! 'tis she's full of glee,
      They are fried with fat rashers of bacon.

          Just like daisies all spread
          O'er a broad sunny mead,
      In the sunbeams so beauteously shining,
          Are fried eggs fair displayed
          On a dish, when we've laid
      The cloth and are thinking of dining.
