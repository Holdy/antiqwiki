FOOTNOTES:

[530] _Otia Imperialia_, p. 987: see above p. 302 _et alib_.

[531] Like the Irish _Play the Puck_, above, p. 371.

[532] _Otia Imper._ p. 981: see above, p. 394. It does not appear that
the abode of these porpoise-knights was beneath the water.

[533] _Otia Imper._ p. 897. See above p. 407. Orthone, the
House-spirit, who, according to Froissart, attended the Lord of
Corasse, in Gascony, resembled Hinzelmann in many points.

[534] Ibid.

[535] _Hujusmodi larvarum._ He classes the Fadas with Sylvans and Pans.

[536] P. 989. Speaking of the wonderful horse of Giraldus de
Cabreriis; Gervase says, _Si Fadus erat, i. e._ says Leibnitz,
incantatus, ut _Fadæ, Fatæ, Fées_.

[537] Cambry, Monumens Celtiques, p. 342. The author says, that
Esterelle, as well as all the Fairies, was the moon. This we very much
doubt. He derives her name from the Breton _Escler_, Brightness,
Lauza, from _Lac'h_ (Irish _Cloch_), a flat stone.

Normandie, etc., p. 92: see above, pp. 161, 342.

[539] See Leroux de Lincy, _ap._ Mlle. Bosquet, p. 93, who adds "In
Lower Normandy, in the arrondissement of Bayeux, they never neglect
laying a table for the protecting genius of the babe about to be born;"
see our note on Virg. Buc. iv. 63. In a collection of decrees of
Councils made by Burchard of Worms, who died in 1024, we read as
follows: "Fecisti, ut quaedam mulieres in quibusdam temporibus anni
facere solent, ut in domo tua _mensam praepares_ et tuos cibos et potum
cum _tribus cultellis_ supra mensam poneres, ut si venissent _tres illae
sorores_ quas antiqua posteritas et antiqua stultitia Parcas nominavit,
ibi reficirentur ... ut credens illas quas tu dieis esse sorores tibi
posse aut hic aut in futuro prodesse?" GRIMM. _Deut. Mythol. Anhang_, p.
xxxviii., where we are also told that these Parcæ could give a man at
his birth the power of becoming a Werwolf. All this, however, does not
prove that they were the origin of the _Fées_: see above, p. 6.

[540] This may remind us of the Neck or Kelpie above, p. 162. It seems
confirmatory of our theory respecting the Visigoths, p. 466.

[544] It is evidently a _cromleach_. What is said of the nature of the
stones is also true of Stonehenge.

of Bordeaux.

[546] See Mlle. Bosquet, La Normandie Romanesque et Merveilleuse, and
the works there quoted by this learned and ingenious lady. What
follows is so extremely like what we have seen above of the Korrigan
of the adjacent Brittany, that we hope she has been careful not to
transfer any of their traits to her Fées.

[547] Opera i. 1036; Paris, 1674, _ap._ Grimm, Deut. Mythol. p. 263.

[548] _Ap._ Grimm, _ut sup._ Douce (Ill. of Shak. i. 382) was, we
believe, the first who directed attention to Abundia. He quotes from
an old _fabliau_:

      Ceste richesse nus abonde,
      Nos l'avons de par Dame Abonde.


[549]

      One kind of these the Italians Fatæ name;
      Fée the French; we Sybils; and the same
      Other White Nymphs; and those that have them seen,
      Night Ladies some, of which Habundia queen.
                                    _Hierarchie_, viii. p. 507.


[550] Mr. Thoms prefers a derivation from the Cymric, _Mab_, boy, child.

[551] There is no satisfactory derivation of _Lutin_, for we cannot
regard as such Grimm's _à luctu_. _Gobelin_, _Goblin_, or _Goubelin_,
is evidently the same as _Kobold_. _Follet_ (from _fol_, _fou_) and
_Farfadet_, are other names. Both _Gobelin_ and _Lutin_ were in use in
the 11th century. Orderic Vitalis, speaking of the demon whom St.
Taurin drove out of the temple of Diana, says, _Hunc vulgus Gobelinum
appellat_, and Wace (Roman de Rou, _v_ 9715) says of the familiar of
bishop Mauger who excommunicated the Conqueror
