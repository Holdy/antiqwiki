FOOTNOTES:

[519] Otia Imperialia, p. 982. The Demons must have been some kind of
fairies: see above, p. 4.

[520] Related by Sir Francis Palgrave, but without giving any
authority, in the Quarterly Review, vol. xxii. See _France_.

[521] In Don Quixote (part i. chap. 50) we read of "los siete
castillos de las siete Fadas" beneath the lake of boiling pitch, and
of the fair princess who was enchanted in one of them.

[522] _Fada_ is certainly the elided part. of this verb, for the Latin
mode of elision (see above p. 7.) was retained in Spanish as well as
Italian. Thus _quedo_, _junto_, _harto_, _marchito_, _vacio_,
_enjuto_, _violento_, &c., come from _quedar_, _juntar_, _hartar_, &c.
As the Spanish, following the Latin, also frequently uses the past as
a present participle, as _un hombre atrevido_, "a daring man;" and the
same appears to take place in Italian, as _un huomo accorto_,
_saputo_, _avveduto_, _dispietato_; and even in French, as _un homme
réfléchi_, _désespéré_; may we not say that _fada_, _fata_, _fée_, is
enchant_ing_ rather than enchant_ed_?

[523] _Montina_ is a small wood.

[524] Romancero Castellano por Depping, ii. p. 198, 2nd edit. A
translation of this romance will be found in Thoms's Lays and Legends
of Spain.

[525] _i. e._ Joey the Hunchback. Pepito is the dim. of Pepe, _i. e._
José, Joseph.

[526] See Thoms's Lays and Legends of Spain, p. 83. It was related, he
says, to a friend of his by the late Sir John Malcolm, who had heard it
in Spain. It is also briefly related (probably on the same authority) in
the Quarterly Review, vol. xxii. (see above pp. 364, 438). Redi, in his
Letters, gives another form of it, in which the scene is at Benevento,
the agents are witches, and the hump is taken off, _senza verun suo
dolor_, with a saw of butter. _Y Domingo siete_ is, we are told, a
common phrase when any thing is said or done _mal à propos_.

[527] Teatro Critico, tom. ii. His object is to disprove their
existence, and he very justly says that the Duende was usually a knavish
servant who had his own reasons for making a noise and disturbing the
family. This theory will also explain the Duende-tales of Torquemada.

[528] See Tales and Popular Fictions, p. 269.

[529] The change of _r_ and _n_ is not without examples. Thus we have
[Greek: arguron] and _argentum_; _water_, English; _vand_, Danish;
_vatn_, Swedish. _Cristofero_ is _Cristofano_ in Tuscan; _homine_,
_nomine_, _sanguine_, are _hombre_, _nombre_, _sangre_, Spanish. In
_Duerg_ when _r_ became _n_, euphony changed _g_ to _d_, or _vice
versâ_. The changes words undergo when the derivation is certain, are
often curious. _Alguacil_, Spanish, is _El-wezeer_ Arab, as _Azucena_
Spanish, _Cecem_ Portuguese (white-lily) is _Sûsan_ Arab; _Guancia_
(cheek) Italian, is _Wange_ German; [Greek: Naupaktos] has become
_Lépanto_. It might not be safe to assert that the Persian _gurk_ and
our _wolf_ are the same, and yet the letters in them taken in order
are all commutable. Our _God be with you_ has shrunk to _Goodbye_, and
the Spanish _Vuestra merced_ to _Usted_, pr. _Usté_. There must, by
the way, some time or other, have been an intimate connexion between
Spain and England, so many of our familiar words seem to have a
Spanish origin. Thus _ninny_ is from _niño_; _booby_ from _bobo_;
_pucker_ from _puchero_; _launch_ (a boat) from _lancha_; and perhaps
_monkey_ (if not from _mannikin_) from _mono_, _monico_. We pronounce
our _colonel_ like the Spanish _coronel_.
