                     _Alexander Selkirk's Dream._

           COMPOSED ONE DAY WHEN CONFINED TO BED BY A COLD
                         AND UNABLE TO READ.

      O'er the isle of Juan Fernandez
        Cooling shades of evening spread,
      While upon the peaks of Andes
        Still the tints of day were shed.

      From the sea-beat shore returning
        Homeward hied the lonely man,
      O'er his cheerless fortune mourning,
        As through past days memory ran.

      Soon his brief repast was ended
        And he sought his lowly bed;
      Balmy slumber there descended,
        Shedding influence o'er his head.

      Then a vision full of gladness
        Came, sent forth by Him supreme
      Who his suffering servants' sadness
        Oft dispelleth in a dream.
