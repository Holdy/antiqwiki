summary: In Strathspey, two Brownies named Brownie-Clod and Maug Vuluchd, served the Tullochgorm family; Brownie-Clod flung clods at passersby and was overreached by servants, while Maug managed housekeeping tasks invisibly with strict oversight of the maids. Despite being tricked into receiving payment early, Brownie-Clod was sometimes able to outwit the servants, a theme similarly depicted in another story on the Western Isles where a Brownie helped a person playing draughts at Sir Norman M'Leodâ€™s.
