                    _The Fairy borrowing Oatmeal._

A fairy came one day from one of the turrets of Craig-ail-naic to the
wife of one of the tenants in Delnabo, and asked her to lend her a
firlot of oatmeal for food for her family, promising to repay it soon,
as she was every moment expecting an ample supply. The woman complied
with this request, and after, as was the custom of the country, having
regaled her with bread, cheese, and whiskey, she went, as was usual,
to see her a part of the way home. When they had reached the summit of
an eminence near the town, the _BÃ©anshi_ told her she might take her
meal home again as she was now abundantly supplied. The woman did as
desired, and as she went along she beheld the corn-kiln of an adjacent
farm all in a blaze.
