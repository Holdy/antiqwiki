                             _The Grant._

"There is," says he, again[326] "in England a certain kind of demon
whom in their language they call Grant,[327] like a yearling foal,
erect on its hind legs, with sparkling eyes. This kind of demon often
appears in the streets in the heat of the day, or about sunset. If
there is any danger impending on the following day or night, it runs
about the streets provoking the dogs to bark, and, by feigning flight,
draws the dogs after it, in the vain hope of catching it. This
illusion warns the inhabitants to beware of fire, and the friendly
demon, while he terrifies those who see him, puts by his coming the
ignorant on their guard."
