Another version says the Doctor is presented with a box of eye-salve
by his conductor; on using it he sees a splendid portico in the side
of a steep hill, through this he is shown into the faries' hall in the
interior of the mountain: he performs his office, and on coming out
receives a second box; he rubs one eye, and with it sees the hill in
its natural shape; then thinking to cheat the devil, feigns to rub the
other, and gallops off. Afterwards he sees the fary's husband stealing
corn in the market, when similar consequences befal him as those which
occurred unto the woman.
