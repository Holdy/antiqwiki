summary: In 1660, a farmer's wife in Ragunda helped a Troll's wife through childbirth and received pieces of silver as gratitude, which were left in their sitting-room. The encounter with the Troll, described as a small, darkly-dressed man, occurred when the couple was alone at their farm, illustrating the mysterious nature of the Vettar spirits in local folklore.
