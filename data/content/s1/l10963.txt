FOOTNOTES:

[294] This legend seems to be connected with the ancient idea of the
water-deities taking the souls of drowned persons to themselves. In
the Edda, this is done by the sea-goddess Ran.

[297] A tale of this kind is to be seen in Luther's Table-talk, told
by _die frau doctorin_, his wife. The scene of it was the river Mulda.
