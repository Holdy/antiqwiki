Where we must observe, as Sir Walter Scott seems not to have been
aware of it, that the four last substantives bear the same relation to
each other as those in the two first verses do.

                             Me bifel a ferly
                             Of _faërie_, me thought.
                                       _Vision of Piers Plowman_, v. 11.

                 Maius that sit with so benigne a chere,
                 Hire to behold it seemed _faërie_.
                                     _Chaucer, Marchante's Tale._

      It (_the horse of brass_) was of _faërie_, as the peple semed,
      Diversè folk diversëly han demed.--_Squier's Tale._

                    The Emperor said on high,
                    Certes it is a _faërie_,
                      Or elles a vanité.--_Emare._

                    With phantasme and _faërie_,
                    Thus she bleredè his eye.--_Libeaus Disconus._

                The God of her has made an end,
                And fro this worldès _faërie_
                Hath taken her into companie.--_Gower, Constance._


Mr. Ritson professes not to understand the meaning of _faerie_ in this
last passage. Mr. Ritson should, as Sir Hugh Evans says, have 'prayed
his pible petter;' where, among other things that might have been of
service to him, he would have learned that 'man walketh in a _vain_
shew,' that 'all is _vanity_,' and that 'the fashion of this world
passeth away;' and then he would have found no difficulty in
comprehending the pious language of 'moral Gower,' in his allusion to
the transitory and deceptive vanities of the world.

2. From the sense of illusion simply, the transition was easy to that
of the land of illusions, the abode of the Faés, who produced them;
and Faerie next came to signify the country of the Fays. Analogy also
was here aiding; for as a Nonnerie was a place inhabited by Nonnes, a
Jewerie a place inhabited by Jews, so a Faerie was naturally a place
inhabited by Fays. Its termination, too, corresponded with a usual one
in the names of countries: Tartarie, for instance, and 'the regne of
Feminie.'

                 Here beside an elfish knight
                 Hath taken my lord in fight,
                 And hath him led with him away
                 Into the _Faërie_, sir, parmafay.--_Sir Guy._
