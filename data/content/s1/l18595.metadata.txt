summary: In Naples, a being known as the Monaciello, described as short and monk-like, is believed to lead those who follow him to hidden treasures, creating sudden riches for the brave. Meanwhile, another tale from Sicily tells of a young man who drags a mute sea maiden ashore; they have a son, but when he pressures her to speak, she vanishes, leaving their child behind, who is later drowned by his mother in the sea.
