                               _Vilas_

      Cherry! dearest Cherry!
      Higher lift thy branches,
      Under which the Vilas
      Dance their magic roundels.
      Them before Radisha
      Dew from flowers, lashes,
      Leadeth on two Vilas,
      To the third he sayeth--
      "Be thou mine, O Vila!
      Thou shalt, with my mother,
      In the cool shade seat thee;
      Soft silk deftly spinning
      From the golden distaff."[582]
