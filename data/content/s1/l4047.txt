                   _The Young Swain and the Elves._

      I was a handsome young swain,
      And to the court should ride.
      I rode out in the evening-hour;
      In the rosy grove I to sleep me laid.
            Since I her first saw.

      I laid me under a lind so green,
      My eyes they sunk in sleep;
      There came two maidens going along,
      They fain would with me speak.
            Since I her first saw.

      The one she tapped me on my cheek,
      The other whispered in my ear:
      "Stand up, handsome young swain,
      If thou list of love to hear."
            Since I her first saw.

      They led then forth a maiden,
      Whose hair like gold did shine:
      "Stand up, handsome young swain,
      If thou to joy incline."
            Since I her first saw.

      The third began a song to sing,
      With good will she did so;
      Thereat stood the rapid stream,
      Which before was wont to flow.
            Since I her first saw.

      Thereat stood the rapid stream,
      Which before was wont to flow;
      And the hind all with her hair so brown,
      Forgot whither she should go.
            Since I her first saw.

      I got me up from off the ground,
      And leaned my sword upon;
      The Elve-women danced in and out,
      All had they the Elve fashión.
            Since I her first saw.

      Had not fortune been to me so good,
      That the cock his wings clapped then,
      I had slept within the hill that night,
      All with the Elve-womén.
            Since I her first saw.[139]
