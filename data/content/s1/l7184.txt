The people of the Feroes call the Nisses or Brownies Ni√§gruisar, and
describe them as little creatures with red caps on their heads, that
bring luck to any place where they take up their abode.

It is the belief of the people of these islands that every ninth-night
the seals put off their skins and assume the human form, and dance and
sport about on the land. After some time, they resume their skins and
return to the water. The following adventure, it is said, once
occurred:[225]

"A man happening to pass by where a female seal was disporting herself
in the form of a woman, found her skin, and took and hid it. When she
could not find her skin to creep into, she was forced to remain in the
human form; and as she was fair to look upon, that same man took her
to wife, had children by her, and lived right happily with her. After
a long time, the wife found the skin that had been stolen, and could
not resist the temptation to creep into it, and so she became a seal
again, and returned to the sea."

The Neck called Nikar is also an object of popular faith in the
Feroes. He inhabits the streams and lakes, and takes a delight in
drowning people.
