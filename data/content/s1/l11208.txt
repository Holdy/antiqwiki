                                ROSY.

        O mother! mother! what? the glittering plate
      And real? and the cloth with their own hands
      Spun by the generous Dwarfs? No, I can ne'er
      Believe it!--Was the thread then, real drawn
      And twisted thread, set in it evenly?
      And was there too a flower, a pretty figure,
      Nicely wrought in with warp and crossing woof?
      Did there a handsome border go all round.
      Enclosing all the figures?--Sure your great-
      Great-grandfather, if really he was
      The owner of the curious little cloth,
      He would have left it carefully unto
      His son and grandson for a legacy,
      That, for a lasting witness of the meal
      Given by the Dwarfs, it might to distant years,
      The praise and wonder of our vale remain.
