summary: The fairy mythology of Southern France includes tales of Dracs, water spirits who lure people to their underwater lairs, with one such story involving a woman taken from the Rhone River to be a nurse for a Drac's child. After seven years, the woman returned to her village with tales of her life under water, gaining vision from an eel-pasty fat but losing sight in one eye after a chance encounter with the Drac in Beaucaire.
