The Neck is called in Rügen Nickel. Some fishers once launched their
boat on a lonely lake. Next day when they came they saw it in a high
beech-tree. "Who the devil has put the boat in the tree?" cried one. A
voice replied, but they saw no one, "'Twas no devil at all, but I and
my brother Nickel."[241]

The following stories Mr. Arndt, who, as we have observed, is a native
of Rügen, says he heard in his boyhood from Hinrich Vieck, the
Statthalter or Bailiff of Grabitz, who abounded in these legends; "so
that it is, properly speaking," says he, "Hinrich Vieck, and not I,
that relates." we therefore see no reason to doubt of their
genuineness, though they may be a little embellished.[242]
