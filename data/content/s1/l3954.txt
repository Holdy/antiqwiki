                    _The Elf-woman and Sir Olof._

      Sir Olof rideth out ere dawn,
          Breaketh day, falleth rime;
      Bright day him came on.
          Sir Olof cometh home,
          When the wood it is leaf-green.

      Sir Olof rides by Borgya,
          Breaketh day, falleth rime;
      Meets a dance of Elves so gay.
          Sir Olof cometh home,
          When the wood it is leaf-green.

      There danceth Elf and Elve-maid,
          Breaketh day, falleth rime;
      Elve-king's daughter, with her flying hair.
          Sir Olof cometh home,
          When the wood it is leaf-green.

      Elve-king's daughter reacheth her hand free,
          Breaketh day, falleth rime;
      "Come here, Sir Olof, tread the dance with me."
          Sir Olof cometh home,
          When the wood it is leaf-green.

      "Nought I tread the dance with thee,"
          Breaketh day, falleth rime;
      "My bride hath that forbidden me."
          Sir Olof cometh home,
          When the wood it is leaf-green.

      "Nought I will and nought I may,"
          Breaketh day, falleth rime;
      "To-morrow is my wedding-day."
          Sir Olof cometh home,
          When the wood it is leaf-green.

      "Wilt thou not tread the dance with me?"
          Breaketh day, falleth rime;
      "An evil shall I fix on thee."
          Sir Olof cometh home,
          When the wood it is leaf-green.

      Sir Olof turned his horse therefrom,
          Breaketh day, falleth rime;
      Sickness and plague follow him home.
          Sir Olof cometh home,
          When the wood it is leaf-green.

      Sir Olof to his mother's rode,
          Breaketh day, falleth rime;
      Out before him his mother stood.
          Sir Olof cometh home,
          When the wood it is leaf-green.

      "Welcome, welcome, my dear son,"
          Breaketh day, falleth rime;
      "Why is thy rosy cheek so wan?"
          Sir Olof cometh home,
          When the wood it is leaf-green.

      "My colt was swift and I tardy,"
          Breaketh day, falleth rime;
      "I knocked against a green oak-tree."
          Sir Olof cometh home,
          When the wood it is leaf-green.

      "My dear sister, prepare my bed,"
          Breaketh day, falleth rime;
      "My dear brother, take my horse to the mead."
          Sir Olof cometh home,
          When the wood it is leaf-green.

      "My dear mother, brush my hair,"
          Breaketh day, falleth rime;
      "My dear father, make me a bier."
          Sir Olof cometh home,
          When the wood it is leaf-green.

      "My dear son, that do not say,"
          Breaketh day, falleth rime;
      To-morrow is thy wedding-day."
          Sir Olof cometh home,
          When the wood it is leaf-green.

      "Be it when it will betide,"
          Breaketh day, falleth rime;
      "I ne'er shall come unto my bride."
          Sir Olof cometh home,
          When the wood it is leaf-green.[138]
