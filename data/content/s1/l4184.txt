                          _Hans Puntleder._

There are three hills on the lands of Bubbelgaard in Funen, which are
to this day called the Dance-hills, from the following occurrence. A
lad named Hans was at service in Bubbelgaard, and as he was coming one
evening past the hills, he saw one of them raised on red pillars, and
great dancing and much merriment underneath. He was so enchanted with
the beauty and magnificence of what he saw, that he could not restrain
his curiosity, but was in a strange and wonderful manner attracted
nearer and nearer, till at last the fairest of all the fair maidens
that were there came up to him and gave him a kiss. From that moment
he lost all command of himself, and became so violent, that he used to
tear to pieces all the clothes that were put on him, so that at last
they were obliged to make him a dress of sole-leather, which he could
not pull off him; and ever after he went by the name of Hans
Puntleder, i. e. Sole-leather.
