                        _Kallundborg Church._

When Esbern Snare was about building a church in Kallundborg, he saw
clearly that his means were not fully adequate to the task. But a
Troll came to him and offered his services; and Esbern Snare made an
agreement with him on these conditions, that he should be able to tell
the Troll's name when the church was finished; or in case he could
not, that he should give him his heart and his eyes.

The work now went on rapidly, and the Troll set the church on stone
pillars; but when all was nearly done, and there was only half a
pillar wanting in the church, Esbern began to get frightened, for the
name of the Troll was yet unknown to him.

One day he was going about the fields all alone, and in great anxiety
on account of the perilous state he was in; when, tired, and
depressed, by reason of his exceeding grief and affliction, he laid
him down on Ulsh√∂i bank to rest himself a while. While he was lying
there, he heard a Troll-woman within the hill saying these words:--

                        "Lie still, baby mine!
                         To-morrow cometh Fin,
                         Father thine,
      And giveth thee Esbern Snare's eyes and heart to play with."[179]

When Esbern heard this, he recovered his spirits, and went back to
the church. The Troll was just then coming with the half-pillar that
was wanting for the church; but when Esbern saw him, he hailed him by
his name, and called him "Fin." The Troll was so enraged at this, that
he went off with the half-pillar through the air, and this is the
reason that the church has but three pillars and a half.[180]
