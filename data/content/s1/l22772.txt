                             _To Amanda._

    [These are the verses quoted in the Introduction to the "Tales and
    Popular Fictions." The author was very young when he wrote them;
    and Amanda was, like Beatrice and Laura, a mere _donna di mente_,
    having no real existence.]

      As when a storm in vernal skies
        The face of day doth stain,
      And o'er the smiling landscape flies,
        With mist and drizzling rain;
      If chance the sun look through the shower
        O'er flowery hill and dale,
      Reviving Nature owns his power,
        And softly sighs the gale:

      So when, by anxious thoughts oppressed,
        My soul sinks in despair,
      When smiling hope deserts my breast,
        And all is darkness there;
      If chance Amanda's form appear,
        The gloom is chased away,
      My soul once more her soft smiles cheer,
        And joy resumes his sway.

      Then, dear Amanda, since thy smile
        Has power all gloom to charm,
      Oh! ever thus my cares beguile,
        And guard my soul from harm.
      Let Hymen's bands our fates unite,
        What bliss may then be ours!--
      Our days will glide, like streamlets bright,
        O'erhung with fragrant flowers.


                               _Lines_,

                WRITTEN AT HOME IN THE SPRING OF 1842.

      Fair Tibur, once the Muses' home,
        Before us lay; around
      Was spread the plain which mighty Rome
        Oft saw with victory crowned.

      The sun rode high, the sky was clear,
        The lark poured forth his strain,
      And flowers, the firstlings of the year,
        Shed fragrance o'er the plain.

      A gentle lady turned on me
        Her bright expressive eyes,
      And bade the flame of poesy
        Within my bosom rise.

      'Twas then I felt, I felt, alas!
        How Time has dealt with me,
      And how the rays of fancy pass,
        And vanish utterly.

      For time has been when such a view
        And mandate of the fair,
      With images of brightest hue,
        Had fill'd the land and air:

      While now I strive, and strive in vain,
        To twine poetic flowers,
      Since from me Time away has ta'en
        Imagination's powers.

      Then lady, be thou gentle still,
        Let pity sway thy breast;
      Accept for deeds the fervent will
        To honour thy behest.
