There are many other tales in Germany of midwives, and even ladies of
rank, who have been called in to assist at Nix or Dwarf labours. The
Ahnfrau von Ranzau, for example, and the Frau von Alvensleben--the
Ladies Bountiful of Germany--were waked up in the night to attend the
little women in their confinement.[297] There is the same danger in
touching anything in the Dwarf as in the Nix abodes, but the Dwarfs
usually bestow rings and other articles, which will cause the family
to flourish. We have seen tales of the same kind in Scandinavia, and
shall meet with them in many other countries.
