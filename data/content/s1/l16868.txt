"If," says the learned archdeacon, "a scrupulous inquirer should ask
my opinion of the relation here inserted, I answer, with Augustine,
'admiranda fore divina miracula non disputatione discutienda;' nor do
I, by denial, place bounds to the Divine power; nor, by affirming
insolently, extend that power which cannot be extended. But on such
occasions I always call to mind that saying of Hieronymus: "Multa,"
says he, 'incredibilia reperies et non verisimilia, qu√¶ nihilominus
tamen vera sunt.' These, and any such that might occur, I should
place, according to Augustine's opinion, among those things which are
neither to be strongly affirmed nor denied."

David Powel, who edited this work in 1585, thinks that this legend is
written in imitation of the relation of Eros the Armenian, in Plato,
or taken from Polo's account of the garden of the Old Man of the
Mountain.[460]

Again Giraldus writes,--"In these parts of Penbroch it has happed, in
our times, that unclean spirits have conversed with mankind, not indeed
visibly, but sensibly; for they manifested their presence at first in
the house of one Stephen Wiriet, and some time after of William Not, by
throwing dirt and such things as rather indicate an intention of mockery
and injury. In the house of William, the spirit used to make rents and
holes in both linen and woollen garments, to the frequent loss of both
host and guest, from which injury no care and no bolts could protect
them. In the house of Stephen, which was still more extraordinary, the
spirit used to converse with people; and when they taunted him, which
they frequently did out of sport, he used to charge them openly with
those actions of theirs, from their birth, which they least wished to be
heard or known by others. If you ask the cause and reason of this
matter, I do not take on me to assign it; only this, that it, as is
said, used to be the sign of a sudden change, either from poverty to
riches, or rather from riches to desolation and poverty, as it was found
to be a little after with both of these. But this I think worthy of
remark, that places cannot be freed from illusions of this kind by the
sprinkling of holy water, not merely of the ordinary, but even of the
great kind; nor by the aid of any ecclesiastical sacrament. Nay, the
priests themselves, when coming in with devotion, and fortified as well
with the cross as with holy water, were forthwith among the first
defiled by the dirt thrown at them. From which it would appear that both
sacramentals and sacraments defend from hurtful, not harmless things,
and from injury, not from illusion."[461]
