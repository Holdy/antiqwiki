FOOTNOTES:

[286] This word is usually derived from the Greek [Greek: kobalos], a
knave, which is found in Aristophanes. According to Grimm (p. 408) the
German Kobold is not mentioned by any writer anterior to the thirteenth
century, we find the French Gobelin in the eleventh; see _France_.

[287] In Hanover the Will-o'the-wisp is called the Tückebold, _i. e._
Tücke-Kobold, and is, as his name denotes, a malicious being. Voss.
Lyr. Ged., ii. p. 315.

[288] Deutsche Sagen, i. p. 103. Feldmann's work is a 12mo vol. of 379
pages.

[289] Heinze is the abbreviation of Heinrich (Henry). In the North of
Germany the Kobold is also named Chimmeken and Wolterken, from Joachim
and Walther.

[290] This is a usual measure of size for the Dwarfs, and even the
angels, in the old German poetry; see above, p. 208. In Otnit it is
said of Elberich: _nu bist in Kindes mâze des vierden jâres alt_; and
of Antilois in Ulrich's Alexander: _er war kleine und niht grôz in der
mâze als diu kint, wenn si in vier jâren sint_, Grimm, Deut. Mythol.,
p. 418. We meet with it even in Italian poetry:

      E sovra il dorso un nano si piccino
      Che sembri di quattr' anni un fanciullino.
                            B. Tasso, Amadigi, C. c. st. 78.


[291] The feats of House-spirits, it is plain, may in general be
ascribed to ventriloquism and to contrivances of servants and others.
