The Nis of Jutland is called Puk[282] in Friesland. Like him he wears
a pointed red cap, with a long grey or green jacket, and slippers on
his feet. His usual abode is under the roof, and he goes in and out
either through a broken window, which is never mended, or through some
other aperture left on purpose for him. A bowl of groute must be left
on the floor for him every evening, and he is very angry if there
should be no butter in it. When well treated he makes himself very
useful by cleaning up the house, and tending the cattle. He sometimes
amuses himself by playing tricks on the servants, tickling, for
example, their noses when they are asleep, or pulling off the
bed-clothes. Stories are told of the Puk, similar to some above
related of the Juttish Nis.
