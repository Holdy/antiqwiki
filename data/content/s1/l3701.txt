[125] The reader will find a beautiful instance of a double Omquæd in
the Scottish ballad of the Cruel Sister.

      There were two sisters sat in a bower,
                          _Binnorie o Binnorie_
      There came a knight to be their wooer
        _By the bonny mill-dams of Binnorie._

And in the Cruel Brother,

      There were three ladies played at the ba',
        _With a heigh ho and a lily gay_;
      There came a knight and played o'er them a',
        _As the primrose spreads so sweetly_.

The second and fourth lines are repeated in every stanza.

[126] These are the Swedish verses:

      Det växte upp _Liljor_ på begge deres graf,
      _Med äran och med dygd_--
      De växte tilsamman med alla sina blad.
      _J vinnen väl, J vinnen väl både rosor och liljor._
      Det växte upp _Rosor_ ur båda deras mun,
      _Med äran och med dygd_--
      De växte tilsammans i fagreste lund.
      _J vinnen väl, J vinnen väl både rosor och liljor._


[127] Some readers may wish to know the proper mode of pronouncing such
Danish and Swedish words as occur in the following legends. For their
satisfaction we give the following information. J is pronounced as our
_y_; when it comes between a consonant and a vowel, it is very short,
like the y that is expressed, but not written, in many English words
after _c_ and _g_: thus _kjær_ is pronounced very nearly as _care_: _ö_
sounds like the German _ö_, or French _eu_: _d_ after another consonant
is rarely sounded, Trold is pronounced Troll: _aa_, which the Swedes
write _å_, as o in _more_, _tore_. Aarhuus is pronounced _Ore-hoos_.
