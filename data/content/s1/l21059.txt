                           _The Mazik-Ass._

It came to pass in the countries of Africa, in a particular month,
during which it is the usage and the custom of the Jews to rise in the
night to say their prayers, that a servant, whose business it was to
knock at the doors, and to call up the people, found one night an ass
(_jumento_) in the street; and he mounted upon him, and went riding
along and calling up the people. And, as he rode, lo! the ass began to
swell and to increase in size, until he became three hundred yards in
height, and reached up even unto the top of the loftiest tower of the
church, upon which he set the man, and then went away; and on the
morrow the man was found sitting upon the tower. Now, thou must know
that this ass was one of the Mazikeen.
