                       _The Working Waterman._

At Seewenweiher, in the Black-Forest, a little Water-man
(_Seem√§nlein_) used to come and join the people, work the whole day
long with them, and in the evening go back into the lakes. They used
to set his breakfast and dinner apart for him. When, in apportioning
the work, the rule of "Not too much and not too little" was infringed,
he got angry, and knocked all the things about. Though his clothes
were old and worn, he steadily refused to let the people get him new
ones. But when at last they would do so, and one evening the lake-man
was presented with a new coat, he said, "When one is paid off, one
must go away. After this day I'll come no more to you." And, unmoved
by the excuses of the people, he never let himself be seen again.[296]
