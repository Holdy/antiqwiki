In Sweden the Tomte is sometimes seen at noon, in summer, slowly and
stealthily dragging a straw or an ear of corn. A farmer, seeing him
thus engaged, laughed, and said, "What difference does it make if you
bring away that or nothing?" The Tomte in displeasure left his farm,
and went to that of his neighbour; and with him went all prosperity
from him who had made light of him, and passed over to the other
farmer. Any one who treated the industrious Tomte with respect, and
set store by the smallest straw, became rich, and neatness and
regularity prevailed in his household.[204]
