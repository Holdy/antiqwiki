                              LETTISH SONG.


Europe is inhabited on the east and north-east, from the Frozen Ocean to
the Adriatic, by two extensive races named the Finns and the Slaves. The
former dwell round the northern edge of Scandinavia by the Icy Ocean,
and on the east and south-east of the Baltic. The Majjars, or the
dominant portion of the people of Hungary, are also of Finnish origin.
The Slaves who are akin to the Gotho-German race are also widely spread.
This stem numbers among its branches the Russians, Poles, Bohemians,
Servians, and the nations dwelling north-east of the Adriatic. Our
knowledge of the popular mythology of both races is very limited.
