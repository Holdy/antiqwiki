                        SINCLAR'S VISA.

      A mermaid from the water rose,
      And spaed Sir Sinclar ill.

Fortune-telling has been in all countries a gift of the sea-people. We
need hardly mention the prophecies of Nereus and Proteus.

A girl one time fell into the power of a Havfrue and passed fifteen
years in her submarine abode without ever seeing the sun. At length
her brother went down in quest of her, and succeeded in bringing her
back to the upper world. The Havfrue waited for seven years expecting
her return, but when she did not come back, she struck the water with
her staff and made it boil up and cried--

      Hade jag trott att du varit så falsk,
      Så skulle jag kreckt dig din tiufvehals!

      Had I but known thee so false to be,
      Thy thieving neck I'd have cracked for thee.[216]
