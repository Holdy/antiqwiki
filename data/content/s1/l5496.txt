               _The Tile-Stove jumping over the Brook._

Near Hellested, in Zealand, lived a man, who from time to time
remarked that he was continually plundered. All his suspicions fell on
the Troll-folk, who lived in the neighbouring hill of Ildshöi
(_Fire-hill_), and once hid himself to try and get a sight of the
thief. He had waited there but a very short time when he saw, as he
thought, his tile-stove jumping across the brook. The good farmer was
all astonishment at this strange sight, and he shouted out "Hurra!
there's a jump for a tile-stove!" At this exclamation the Troll, who
was wading through the water with the stove on his head, was so
frightened that he threw it down, and ran off as hard as he could to
Ildshöi. But in the place where the stove fell, the ground got the
shape of it, and the place is called Krogbek (_Hook-brook_), and it
was this that gave rise to the common saying, "That was a jump for a
tile-stove!" "_Det var et Spring af en Leerovn!_"[193]
