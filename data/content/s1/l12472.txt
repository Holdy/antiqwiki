Thus far for the Pixies of Devon; as for the adjoining Somerset, all
we have to say is, that a good woman from that county, with whom we
were acquainted, used, when making a cake, always to draw a cross
upon it. This, she said, was in order to prevent the Vairies from
dancing on it. She described these Vairies as being very small people,
who, with the vanity natural to little personages, wear high-heeled
shoes, and if a new-made cake be not duly crossed, they imprint on it
in their capers the marks of their heels. Of the actual existence of
the Vairies, she did not seem to entertain the shadow of a doubt.

In Dorset also, the Pixy-lore still lingers. The being is called _Pexy_
and _Colepexy_; the fossil belemnites are named Colepexies'-fingers; and
the fossil echini, Colepexies'-heads. The children, when naughty, are
also threatened with the Pexy, who is supposed to haunt woods and
coppices.[349]

"In Hampshire," says Captain Grose, "they give the name of Colt-Pixy
to a supposed spirit or fairy, which in the shape of a horse
_wickers_, i. e. neighs, and misleads horses into bogs, etc."

The following is a Hampshire legend:[350]
