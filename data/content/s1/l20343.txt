                               SLAVES.

      Whatsoe'er at eve had raised the workmen,
      Did the Vila raze ere dawn of morning.
                            BOWRING, _Servian Popular Poetry_.


A demon, in the attire of a mourning widow, used, in the Eastern
Russia, to go through the fields at noon in harvest-time, and break
the legs and arms of the workmen, who failed, when they saw her, to
fall on their faces. There was a remedy, however, against this. Trees,
long venerated, grew in the adjacent wood, the bark of which being
laid on the wound, removed the pain and healed it.[574]

The Vends believe in a similar being; but a Vend knows that when he
converses with her for an hour together about flax and the preparation
of it, if he always contradicts her, or says the paternoster backwards
without stopping, he is secure.[575]

The Russians also believe in a species of water and wood-maids,
called Rusalki. They are of a beautiful form, with long green hair;
they swing and balance themselves on the branches of trees--bathe in
lakes and rivers--play on the surface of the water--and wring their
locks on the green meads at the water's-edge. It is chiefly at
Whitsuntide that they appear, and the people then singing and dancing,
weave garlands for them, which they cast into the stream.[576]
