The fairies are said to take away children, and leave changelings.[468]
They also give pieces of money, one of which is found every day in the
same place as long as the finder keeps his good fortune a secret. One
peculiarity of the Cambrian fairies is, that every Friday night they
comb the goats' beards "to make them decent for Sunday."

We hear not of Brownies or Kobolds in the Welsh houses now, but Puck
used to haunt Wales as well as Ireland. His Welsh name, Pwcca, is the
same as his Irish one. In Brecon there is Cwm Pwcca, or Puck's Glen,
and though an iron-foundry has in a great measure scared him from it,
yet he occasionally makes his appearance. As a man was returning one
night from his work, he saw a light before him, and thought he
discerned some one that carried it. Supposing it to be one of his
fellow-workmen with a lanthorn, he quickened his pace to come up with
him, wondering all the while how so short a man as he appeared to be
could get over the ground so fast. He also fancied he was not going
the right way, but still thought that he who had the light must know
best. At last, he came up with him, and found himself on the very
edge of one of the precipices of Cwm Pwcca, down which another step
would have carried him. The Pwcca, for it was he, sprang over the
glen, turned round, held the light above his head, and then with a
loud laugh put it out and vanished.
