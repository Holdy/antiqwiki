                       _The Fairies Banished._

One of those old farm-houses, where the kitchen and cow-house are on
the same floor, with only a low partition between them, was haunted by
the fairies. If the family were at their meals in the kitchen, _they_
were racketing in the cow-house, and if the people were engaged about
the cows, the fairies were making a riot in the kitchen. One day, when
a parcel of reapers were at their harvest-dinner in the kitchen, the
elves, who were laughing and dancing above, threw down such a quantity
of dust and dirt as quite spoiled the dinner. While the mistress of
the house was in perplexity about it, there came in an old woman, who,
on hearing the case, said she could provide a remedy. She then told
her in a whisper to ask six of the reapers to dinner next day in the
hearing of the fairies, and only to make as much pudding as could be
boiled in an egg-shell. She did as directed, and when the fairies saw
that a dinner for six men was put down to boil in an egg-shell, there
was great stir and noise in the cow-house, and at length one angry
voice was heard to say, "We have lived long in this world; we were
born just after the earth was made, and before the acorn was planted,
and yet we never saw a harvest-dinner dressed in an egg-shell! There
must be something wrong in this house, and we will stop here no
longer." They went away and never returned.
