                              GERTRUDE.

        See now! what industry!--your work itself
      Should keep you waking. I have told you o'er
      A thousand times the stories, and we lose,
      If you grow wearied of them, store of joy
      Reserved for winter-nights; besides, methinks,
      The evening's now too short for chat like this.
