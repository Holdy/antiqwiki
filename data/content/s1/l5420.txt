The following legend is related in Denmark:--

On the lands of Nyegaard lie three large hills, one of which is the
abode of a Troll, who is by trade a blacksmith. If any one is passing
that hill by night, he will see the fire issuing from the top, and
going in again at the side. Should you wish to have any piece of
iron-work executed in a masterly manner, you have only to go to the
hill, and saying aloud what you want to have made, leave there the
iron and a silver shilling. On revisiting the hill next morning, you
will find the shilling gone, and the required piece of work lying
there finished, and ready for use.[190]
