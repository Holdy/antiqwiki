FOOTNOTES:

[87] That is, _elfe_ is _alive_.

[88] These Fairies thus coupled with Nymphs remind us of the Fairies
of the old translators. Spenser, in the Shepherd's Calendar, however,
had united them before, as

      Nor elvish ghosts nor ghastly owls do flee,
      But friendly _Faeries_ met with many Graces,
      And light-foot _Nymphs_.--Ã†g. 6.


[89] "Spenser's _Fairy Queen_, which is one of the grossest misnomers in
romance or history, bears no features of the Fairy nation."--Gifford,
note on B. Jonson, vol. ii. p. 202.
