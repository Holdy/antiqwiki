                                ROSY.

        There's only one thing I desire to hear
      Again, and sure, dear mother, never yet
      Have you explained how 'twas the little men
      Lived in the hills, and how, all through the year,
      They sported round the country here, and gave
      Marks of their kindness. For you'll ne'er persuade
      Me to believe that barely, one by one,
      They wandered in the valleys, and appeared
      Unto the people, and bestowed their gifts:
      So, come now, tell at once, how 'twas the Dwarfs
      Lived all together in society.
