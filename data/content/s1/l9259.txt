                               DWARFS.

      Fort, fort! Mich schau' die Sonne nicht,
        Ich darf nicht langer harren;
      Mich Elfenkind vor ihren Licht
        Sähst du sum Fels erstarren.
                            LA MOTTE FOUQUÉ.

      Away! let not the sun view me,
        I dare no longer stay;
      An Elfin-child thou wouldst me see,
        To stone turn at his ray.


These beings are called Zwerge (_Dwarfs_), Berg- and Erd-mänlein (_Hill_
and _Ground-mannikins_), the Stille Volk (_Still-people_), and the
Kleine Volk (_Little-people_).[260] The following account of the
Still-people at Plesse will give the popular idea respecting them.[261]

At Plesse, a castle in the mountains in Hesse, are various springs,
wells, clefts and holes in the rocks, in which, according to popular
tradition, the Dwarfs, called the Still-people, dwell. They are silent
and beneficent, and willingly serve those who have the good fortune to
please them. If injured they vent their anger, not on mankind, but on
the cattle, which they plague and torment. This subterranean race has no
proper communication with mankind, but pass their lives within the
earth, where their apartments and chambers are filled with gold and
precious stones. Should occasion require their visit to the surface of
the earth, they accomplish the business in the night, and not by day.
This Hill-people are of flesh and bone, like mankind, they bear children
and die, but in addition to the ordinary faculties of humanity, they
have the power of making themselves invisible, and of passing through
rocks and walls, with the same facility as through the air. They
sometimes appear to men, lead them with them into clifts, and if the
strangers prove agreeable to them, present them with valuable
gifts.[262]
