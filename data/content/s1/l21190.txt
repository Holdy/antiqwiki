FOOTNOTES:

[597] Under the title Similar Legends in the Index, legends of this
kind are arranged with references to the places where they occur.

[598] The legends from the German and other languages are, in general,
faithfully translated, whence the style is at times rude and negligent;
English legends are for the most part, also, merely transcribed.
