                                ROSY.

        True, mother, but every minute sleep
      Falls on my eyes as heavy as lead, and I
      Must yawn do what I will; and then God knows
      I can't help nodding though 'twere for my life;
      Or ... oh! it might be of some use if you
      Would once more, dearest mother, tell about
      The wonderful, good-natured little Dwarfs,
      What they here round the country used to do,
      And how they showed their kindness to the hinds.
