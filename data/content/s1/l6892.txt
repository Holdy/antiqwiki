      The Neck here his harp in the glass-castle plays,

Under the title of Northern Islands we include all those lying in the
ocean to the north of Scotland, to wit Iceland, the Feroes, Shetland,
and the Orkneys.

These islands were all peopled from Norway and Denmark during the
ninth century. Till that time many of them, particularly Iceland and
the Feroes, though, perhaps, occasionally visited by stray Vikings, or
by ships driven out of their course by tempests, had lain waste and
desert from the creation, the abode alone of wild beasts and birds.

But at that period the proud nobles of Norway and Denmark, who scorned
to be the vassals of Harold Fairhair and Gorm the Old, the founders of
the Norwegian and Danish monarchies, set forth in quest of new
settlements, where, at a distance from these haughty potentates, they
might live in the full enjoyment of their beloved independence. Followed
by numerous vassals, they embarked on the wide Atlantic. A portion fixed
themselves on the distant shores of Iceland; others took possession of
the vacant Feroes; and more dispossessed the Peti and Pap√¶, the ancient
inhabitants of Shetland and the Orkneys, and seized on their country.

As the Scandinavians were at that time still worshipers of Thor and
Odin, the belief in Alfs and Dwarfs accompanied them to their new
abodes, and there, as elsewhere, survived the introduction of
Christianity. We now proceed to examine the vestiges of the old
religion still to be traced.
