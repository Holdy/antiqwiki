summary: The Cauld Lad of Hilton was a Brownie who caused mischief at Hilton Hall by rearranging items in the kitchen, much to the chagrin of the servants. To rid themselves of the spirit, the servants offered him a green cloak and hood, leading to his joyful departure, but his melancholy voice could still be heard singing at midnight.
