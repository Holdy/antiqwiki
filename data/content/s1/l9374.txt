                        _The Friendly Dwarfs._

Close to the little town of Dardesheim, between Halberstadt and
Brunswick, is a spring of the finest water called the Smansborn, and
which flows out of a hill in which in old times the dwarfs dwelt. When
the former inhabitants of the country were in want of a holiday-dress,
or, at a family festival, of any rare utensils, they went and stood
before this Dwarf-hill, knocked three times, and pronounced their
petition in a distinct and audible tone, adding,

      Before the sun is up to-morrow.
      At the hill shall be the things we borrow.[265]

The Dwarfs thought themselves sufficiently compensated if there was
only some of the festive victuals set down before the hill.
