Such is the sum of what we have been able to collect respecting the
popular fairy-lore of England, the largest and most complete
collection that, to our knowledge, has ever been made. We might
venture to add that little more is ever likely to be collected, for
the sounds of the cotton-mill, the steam-engine, and, more than all,
the whistle of the railway train, more powerful than any exorcists,
have banished, or soon will banish, the fairy tribes from all their
accustomed haunts, and their name and their exploits will in future be
found in works like the present rather than in village tradition.

As the merry spirit, Puck, is so prominent an actor in the scenes
forming our next division, this may be deemed no unfitting place for
the consideration of his various appellations; such as Puck, Robin
Good-fellow, Robin Hood, Hobgoblin.

Puck is evidently the same with the old word _Pouke_,[361] the
original meaning of which would seem to be devil, demon, or evil
spirit. We first meet with it in the Vision of Piers Ploughman, where
it undoubtedly signifies 'the grand adversary of God and man.'

When, in this poem,[362] the Seer beholds Abraham, the personification
of Faith, with his "wide clothes," within which lay a Lazar,

      Amonges patriarkes and prophetes,
      Pleying togideres,

and asks him what was there,

      Loo! quod he, and leet me see.
      Lord mercy! I seide;
      This is a present of muche pris,
      What prynce shal it have?
      It is a precious present, quod he,
      Ac the _pouke_ it hath attached,
      And me theremyde, quod that man,
      May no wed us quyte,

      Ne no buyrn be oure borgh,
      Ne bringe us from his daunger;
      Out of the _poukes pondfold_
      No maynprise may us fecche,
      Til he come that I carpe of,
      Crist is his name,
      That shall delivere us som day
      Out of the _develes_ power.

Golding also must have understood Pooke in the sense of devil, when in
the ninth book of his translation of Ovid, unauthorised however by
the original, he applies it to the Chimæra,

            The country where Chymæra, that same _pooke_
      Hath goatish body, lion's head and brist, and dragon's tayle.

Spenser employs the word, and he clearly distinguishes it from
hob-goblin:

      Ne let housefires nor lightnings helpless harms,
      Ne let the _pouke_[363] nor other evil sprites,
      Ne let mischievous witches with their charms,
      Ne let _hob-goblins_, names whose sense we see not,
      Fray us with things that be not.--_Epithalamion_, v. 340.

These terms are also distinguished in the poem named The Scourge of
Venus:

      And that they may perceive the heavens frown,
      The _poukes_ and _goblins_ pull the coverings down.

In Ben Jonson's play of The Devil is an Ass, the unlucky fiend who gives
origin to its name is called Pug, and in the same author's Sad Shepherd
the personage named Puck-hairy is, as Gifford justly observes, "not the
Fairy or Oriental Puck, though often confounded with him."[364] In
truth, it is first in Shakespeare that we find Puck confounded with the
House-spirit, and having those traits of character which are now
regarded as his very essence, and have caused his name Pug to be given
to the agile mischievous monkey, and to a kind of little dog.

We will now discuss the origin of this far-famed appellation and its
derivation.

In the Slavonic tongues, which are akin to the Teutonic, _Bôg_ is God,
and there are sleights of etymology which would identify the two
terms; the Icelandic Puki is an evil spirit, and such we have seen was
the English Pouke, which easily became Puck, Pug, and Bug; finally, in
Friesland the Kobold is called Puk, and in old German we meet with
Putz or Butz as the name of a being not unlike the original English
Puck.[365] The Devonshire fairies are called Pixies, and the Irish
have their Pooka, and the Welsh their Pwcca, both derived from Pouke
or Puck. From Bug comes the Scottish Bogle, (which Gawin Douglas
expressly distinguishes from the Brownie) and the Yorkshire
Boggart.[366] The Swedish language has the terms _spöka_, _spöke_; the
Danish _spöge_, _spögelse_, the German, _spuken_, _spuk_, all used of
spirits or ghosts, and their apparitions. Perhaps the Scottish
_pawkey_, sly, knowing, may belong to the same family of words. Akin
to Bogle was the old English term Puckle, noticed above, which is
still retained in the sense of mischievous, as in Peregrine Pickle and
Little Pickle. It has been conjectured[367] that _Picklehäring_, the
German term for zany or merry-andrew, may have been properly
_Picklehärin_, _i.e._ the hairy sprite, answering to Jonson's
Puck-hairy, and that he may have worn a vesture of hair or leaves to
be rough like the Brownie and kindred beings.

From Bug also come Bugbear, and Bugleboo, or Bugaboo. They owe their
origin probably to the Ho! Ho! Ho! given to Puck or Robin Goodfellow,
as it was to the Devil (_i.e._, Pouke) in the Mysteries. Bull-beggar
may be only a corruption of Bugbear.[368]

The following passage from a writer of the present day proves that in
some places the idea of Puck as a spirit haunting the woods and fields
is still retained. "The peasantry," says Mr. Allies,[369] "of Alfrick
and those parts of Worcestershire, say that they are sometimes what
they call _Poake-ledden_, that is, that they are occasionally waylaid
in the night by a mischievous sprite whom they call Poake, who leads
them into ditches, bogs, pools, and other such scrapes, and then sets
up a loud laugh and leaves them quite bewildered in the lurch." This
is what in Devon is called being _Pixy-led_. We may observe the
likeness here to the Puck of Shakspeare and Drayton, who were both
natives of the adjoining county.

A further proof perhaps of Puck's rural and extern character is the
following rather trifling circumstance. An old name of the fungus
named _puffball_ is _puckfist_, which is plainly Puck's-fist, and not
_puff-fist_ as Nares conjectured; for its Irish name is
_Cos-a-Phooka_, or Pooka's-foot, _i.e._, Puck's-foot. We will add by
the way, that the Anglo-Saxon [Old English: Wulfes-fist], Wolf's-fist,
is rendered in the dictionaries toadstool, mushroom, and we cannot
help suspecting that as wolf and elf were sometimes confounded, and
wolf and fist are, in fact, incompatible terms, this was originally
[Old English: Ælfes-fist] Elf's-fist, and that the mushrooms meant
were not the thick ugly toadstools, the "grislie todestooles," of
Spenser, but those delicate fungi called in Ireland _fairy-mushrooms_,
and which perhaps in England also were ascribed to the fairies.[370]

So much then for Puck; we will now consider some other terms.

       *       *       *       *       *

Robin Goodfellow, of whom we have given above a full account, is
evidently a domestic spirit, answering in name and character to the
Nisse God-dreng of Scandinavia, the Knecht Ruprecht, _i.e._, Robin of
Germany. He seems to unite in his person the Boggart and Barguest of
Yorkshire.

Hob-goblin is, as we have seen, another name of the same spirit.
Goblin is the French _gobelin_, German Kobold; Hob is Rob, Robin, Bob;
just as Hodge is Roger. We still have the proper names Hobbs, Hobson,
like Dix, Dixon, Wills, Wilson; by the way, Hick, _i. e._ Dick, from
Richard, still remains in Hicks, Hickson.

Robin Hood, though we can produce no instance of it, must, we think,
also have been an appellation of this spirit, and been given to the
famed outlaw of merry Sherwood, from his sportive character and his
abiding in the recesses of the greenwood. The hood is a usual
appendage of the domestic spirit.

Roguery and sportiveness are, we may see, the characteristics of this
spirit. Hence it may have been that the diminutives of proper names were
given to him, and even to the Ignis Fatuus, which in a country like
England, that was in general dry and free from sloughs and bog-holes,
was mischievous rather than dangerous.[371] But this seems to have been
a custom of our forefathers, for we find the devil himself called Old
Nick, and Old Davy is the sailor's familiar name for Death.

In the Midsummer Night's Dream the fairy says to Puck "Thou Lob of
spirits;" Milton has the _lubber-fiend_, and Fletcher says,[372]
"There is a pretty tale of a witch that had a giant to be her son that
was called Lob Lie-by-the-fire." This might lead us to suppose that
_Lob_, whence _loby_ (looby), _lubbard_, _lubber_,[373] and adding the
diminutive _kin_, Lubberkin, a name of one of the clowns in Gay's
Pastorals, was an original name of some kind of spirit. We shall
presently see that the Irish name of the Leprechaun is actually
Lubberkin. As to the origin of the name we have little to say, but it
may have had a sense the very opposite of the present one of _lubber_,
and have been connected with the verb _to leap_.[374] Grimm[375] tells
of a spirit named the Good Lubber, to whom the bones of animals used
to be offered at Mansfield in Germany; but we see no resemblance
between him and our Lob of spirits; we might rather trace a connexion
with the French Lutin, Lubin.[376] The phrase of _being in_ or
_getting into Lob's Pound_ (like the "Pouke's pondfold,") is easy of
explanation, if we suppose Lob to be a sportive spirit. It is
equivalent to being _Poake-ledden_ or _Pixy-led_.

Wight, answering to the German _Wicht_, seems to have been used in the
time of Chaucer for elf or fairy, most probably for such as haunted
houses, or it may have had the signification of _witch_, which is
evidently another form of it. In the Miller's Tale the carpenter says,

      I crouchè thee from elvès and from _wights_.

And

      Jesu Crist, and Seint Benedight,
      Blisse this house from every wicked _wight_![377]

Urchin is a term which, like _elf_ and such like, we still apply to
children, but which seems formerly to have been one of the
appellations of the fairies. Reginald Scott, as we have seen, places
it in his list, and we find it in the following places of the poets:--
