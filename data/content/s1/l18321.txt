[491] The tailor cries "Shut the door! Here are the little _Duz_ of
the night" (_Setu ann Duzigou nouz_), and St. Augustine (De Civ. Dei,

for 1826.

[496] The former seems to be a house spirit, the _Goblin_, _Follet_,
or _Lutin_ of the north of France; the latter is apparently the _Ignis
Fatuus_.

[497] So the Yorkshire Bar-guest.
