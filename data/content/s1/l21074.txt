The Jews have, as it were, brought us back to Asia. As we proceed
eastwards from Persia, where we commenced, India first meets our view,
but of the numerous beings of its copious and intricate mythology, no
class seems to belong to earth unless it be the Yakshas who attend on
Kuveras, the Hindoo Plutos, and have charge of his enchanted gardens
on the summit of Himalaya, and who bear some resemblance to the
Dwarfs. There are also the misshapen Pisachas, who love to dwell in
gloom; the Vidhyadharas, _i. e._, Masters of Magic, are said to
resemble the Jinn of the Arabs; and the dancing and singing Gandharvas
and Apsaresas may be compared with the Nymphs of Grecian mythology.

Eastwards still lies China. Here there is a species of beings named
ShinseÃ«n, who are said to haunt the woods and mountains, where, exempt
from the passions and the cares of life, they dwell in a state of
blissful ease; but still exercise an influence over human affairs.
Sometimes they appear as old men with long beards; at other times as
young maidens, sauntering amid rocks and woods by moonlight.[596]

We do not recollect to have met, in our reading, with any other beings
bearing a resemblance to what we term Fairies.
