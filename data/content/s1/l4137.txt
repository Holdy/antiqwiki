                             _Maid Vae._

There was once a wedding and a great entertainment at Oesterhæsinge.
The party did not break up till morning, and the guests took their
departure with a great deal of noise and bustle. While they were
putting their horses to their carriages, previous to setting out home,
they stood talking about their respective bridal-presents. And while
they were talking loudly, and with the utmost earnestness, there came
from a neighbouring moor a maiden clad in green, with plaited rushes
on her head; she went up to the man who was loudest, and bragging most
of his present, and said to him: "What wilt thou give to maid Væ?"
The man, who was elevated with all the ale and brandy he had been
drinking, snatched up a whip, and replied: "Ten cuts of my whip;" and
that very moment he dropt down dead on the ground.[142]
