[239] A Danish legend (Thiele, i. 79) tells the same of the sand-hills
of Nestved in Zealand. A Troll who dwelt near it wished to destroy it,
and for that purpose he went down to the sea-shore and filled his
wallet with sand and threw it on his back. Fortunately there was a
hole in the wallet, and so many sand-hills fell out of it, that when
he came to Nestved there only remained enough to form one hill more.
Another Troll, to punish a farmer filled one of his gloves with sand,
which sufficed to cover his victim's house completely. With what
remained in the fingers he formed a row of hillocks near it.

[242] Grimm also appears to regard them as genuine.

[243] The population of Lusatia (_Lausatz_) is like that of Pomerania
and Rügen, Vendish. Hence, perhaps, it is that in the Lusatian tale of
the Fairy-sabbath, we meet with caps with bells, and a descent into
the interior of a mountain in a kind of boat as in this tale: Wilcomm,
Sagen und Märchen aus der Oberlausitz. Hanov. 1843. Blackwood's
Magazine for June, 1844.

[244] Hinrich Vick's of course, for he is the narrator.
