FOOTNOTES:

[1] The mark on Adam's Peak in Ceylon is, by the Buddhists, ascribed to
Buddha; by the Mohammedans, to Adam. It reminds one of the story of the
lady and the vicar, viewing the moon through a telescope; they saw in
it, as they thought, two figures inclined toward each other: "Methinks,"
says the lady, "they are two fond lovers, meeting to pour forth their
vows by earth-light." "Not at all," says the vicar, taking his turn at
the glass; "they are the steeples of two neighbouring churches."

[2] Faerie Queene, III. c. iii. st. 8, 9, 10, 11. Drayton,
Poly-Olbion, Song VI. We fear, however, that there is only poetic
authority for this belief. Mr. Todd merely quotes Warton, who says
that Spenser borrowed it from Giraldus Cambrensis, who picked it up
among the romantic traditions propagated by the Welsh bards. The
reader will be, perhaps, surprised to hear that Giraldus says nothing
of the demons. He mentions the sounds, and endeavours to explain them
by natural causes. Hollingshed indeed (l. i. c. 24.) says, "whereof
the superstitious sort do gather many toys."

[4] For a well-chosen collection of examples, see the very learned and
philosophical preface of the late Mr. Price to his edition of Warton's
History of English Poetry, p. 28 _et seq._

[5] In the Middle Ages the gods of the heathens were all held to be
devils.

[6] [Greek: Phêr] is the Ionic form of [Greek: thêr], and is nearly
related to the German _thier_, beast, animal. The Scandinavian _dyr_,
and the Anglo-Saxon [Old English: deor], have the same signification;
and it is curious to observe the restricted sense which this last has
gotten in the English _deer_.

[7] Preface to Warton, p. 44; and Breton philologists furnish us with
an etymon; not, indeed, of Fairy, but of Fada. "Fada, fata, etc.,"
says M. de Cambry (Monumens Celtiques), "come from the Breton _mat_ or
_mad_, in construction _fat_, good; whence the English, _maid_."

[8] D'Herbelot _titre_ Mergian says, "C'est du nom de cette Fée que
nos anciens romans ont formé celui de _Morgante la Déconnue_." He here
confounds Morgana with Urganda, and he has been followed in his
mistake. D'Herbelot also thinks it possible that _Féerie_ may come
from _Peri_; but he regards the common derivation from _Fata_ as much
more probable. Cambrian etymologists, by the way, say that Morgain is
Mor Gwynn, the _White Maid_.

[9] These two instances are given by Mdlle. Amélie Bosquet (La
Normandie Romanesque, etc. p. 91.) from Dom Martin, _Rel. des
Gaulois_, ii. ch. 23 and 24.

[12] See below, _France_. It is also remarked that in some of the tales
of the Pentamerone, the number of the _Fate_ is three; but to this it
may be replied, that in Italy every thing took a classic tinge, and that
the Fate of those tales are only Maghe; so in the Amadigi of Bernardo
Tasso we meet with La _Fata_ Urganda. In Spain and France the number
would rather seem to have been seven. Cervantes speaks of "los siete
castillos de las _siete_ fadas;" in the Rom. de la Infantina it is said,
"_siete_ fadas me _fadaron_, en brazos de una ama mia," and the _Fées_
are _seven_ in La Belle au Bois dormant. In the romance, however, of
Guillaume au Court-nez, the _Fées_ who carry the sleeping Renoart out of
the boat are _three_ in number.--See Grimm Deutsche Mythologie, p. 383.

[13] A MS. of the 13th century, quoted by Grimm (_ut sup._ p. 405),
thus relates the origin of Aquisgrani (Aix la Chapelle): Aquisgrani
dicitur Ays, et dicitur eo, quod Karolus tenebat ibi quandam _mulierem
fatatam_, sive quandam _fatam_, quæ alio nomine _nimpha_ vel _dea_ vel
_adriades_ (l. _dryas_) appellatur, et ad hanc consuetudinem habebat,
et eam cognoscebat; et ita erat, quod ipso accedente ad eam vivebat
ipsa, ipso Karolo recedente moriebatur. Contigit dum quadam vice ad
ipsam accessisset ut cum ea delectaretur, radius solis intravit os
ejus, et tunc Karolus vidit _granum auri_ lingue ejus affixum, quod
fecit abscindi et contingenti (l. in continenti) mortua est, nec
postea revixit.

      "Aissim _fadaro_ tres serors
       En aquella ora qu' ieu sui natz
       Que totz temps fos enamoratz."--_Folquet de Romans._

(Thus three sisters _fated_, in the hour that I was born, that I
should be at all times in love.)

"Aissi fuy de nueitz _fadatz_ sobr' un puegau."--_Guilh. de Poitou._
(Thus was I _fated_ by night on a hill.)--Grimm, _ut sup._ p. 383.

[16] Following the analogy of the Gotho-German tongues, _zauberei_,
Germ. _trylleri_, Dan. _trolleri_, Swed. illusion, enchantment. The
Italian word is _fattucchieria_.

[17] Here too there is _perhaps_ an analogy with _cavalry_,
_infantry_, _squierie_, and similar collective terms.

[18] The Faerie Queene was published some years before the Midsummer
Night's Dream. Warton (Obs. on the Faerie Queene) observes: "It appears
from Marston's Satires, printed 1598, that the Faerie Queene occasioned
many publications in which Fairies were the principal actors.

      Go buy some ballad of the FAERY KING.--_Ad Lectorem._

      Out steps some Faery with quick motion,
      And tells him wonders of some flowerie vale--
      Awakes, straight rubs his eyes, and prints his tale.
                                                 B. III. Sat. 6."


[19] It is in this century that we first meet with _Fairy_ as a
dissyllable, and with a plural. It is then used in its fourth and last
sense.

[20] The Fata Morgana of the Straits of Messina is an example; for the
name of Morgana, whencesoever derived, was probably brought into Italy
by the poets.
