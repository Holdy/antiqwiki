rather, merely Fairy- or Spirit-people. See above p. 364.

Edinburgh, 1823. As Mr. Stewart's mode of narrating is not the very
best, we have taken the liberty of re-writing and abridging the legends.

[450] "The goats are supposed to be upon a very good understanding
with the fairies, and possessed of more cunning and knowledge than
their appearance bespeaks."--_Stewart_: see _Wales_.

[452] There is a similar legend in Scandinavia. As a smith was at work
in his forge late one evening, he heard great wailing out on the road,
and by the light of the red-hot iron that he was hammering, he saw a
woman whom a Troll was driving along, bawling at her "A little more! a
little more!" He ran out, put the red-hot iron between them, and thus
delivered her from the power of the Troll (see p. 108). He led her into
his house and that night she was delivered of twins. In the morning he
waited on her husband, who he supposed must be in great affliction at
the loss of his wife. But to his surprise he saw there, in bed, a woman
the very image of her he had saved from the Troll. Knowing at once what
she must be, he raised an axe he had in his hand, and cleft her skull.
The matter was soon explained to the satisfaction of the husband, who
gladly received his real wife and her twins.--Thiele, i. 88. _Oral._

[453] Told, without naming his authority, by the late W. S. Rose, in
the Quarterly Review for 1825.
