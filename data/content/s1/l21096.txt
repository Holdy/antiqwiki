[593] From a rabbinical book called Mahasee Yerusalemee, _i. e._ History
of a Hebrew of Jerusalem.--"Very old," says Moses Edrehi, "and known by
the Hebrews to be true." "Moreover," saith he of another tale, "it
really happened, because every thing that is written in the Jewish books
is true; for no one can print any new book without its being examined
and approved of by the greatest and chiefest Rabbin and wise men of that
time and city, and the proofs must be very strong and clear; so that all
the wonderful stories in these books are true." The Jews are not
singular in this mode of vouching for the truth of wonderful stories.

[594] The moral here is apparent.

[595] From a very ancient rabbinical book called R. H. It is needless
