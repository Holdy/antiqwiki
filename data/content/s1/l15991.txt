FOOTNOTES:

[427] Mr. Croker says, that according to the Munster peasantry the
ordinary attire of the Fairy is a black hat, green coat, white
stockings, and red shoes.

[428] In Irish as in Erse, [Irish Uncial: daine mait] (_deenè mâh_).

[429] See above, p. 26.

[430] They are [Irish Uncial: sia] (_shia_), [Irish Uncial: siabra]
(_shifra_), [Irish Uncial: siacaire] (_shicârè_), [Irish Uncial: sig]
(_shee_), [Irish Uncial: sige] (_sheeè_), [Irish Uncial:
sigib](_sheeidh_) all denoting, spirit, fairy. The term [Irish Uncial:
sig] also signifies a hag, and a hillock, and as an adjective,
spiritual.

[431] We never heard a fairy-legend from any of the Connaught-men with
whom we conversed in our boyhood. Their tales were all of
Finn-mac-Cool and his heroes.

[432] In Irish, [Irish Uncial: dia aoine] (_dhia eenè_). We are
inclined to think that he must have added, [Irish Uncial: dia
dardaoin, dia aoine] (_dhia dhardheen, dhia eenè_), _i.e._ Thursday,
Friday; for we can see no reason for omitting Thursday.

[433] See below, _Brittany_ and _Spain_, in both of which the legend
is more perfect; but it is impossible to say which is the original.
Parnell's pleasing Fairy Tale is probably formed on this Irish
version, yet it agrees more with the Breton legend.

[434] This story may remind one of the Wonderful Lamp, and others.
There is something of the same kind in the Pentamerone.

[435] _Inis_, pronounced sometimes _Inch_, (like the Hebrew _Ee_
([Hebrew: 'y]) and the Indian _Dsib_) is either island or coast, bank of
sea or river. The Ang.-Sax. [Old English: ig] (_ee_) seems to have had
the same extent of signification, hence Chelsea, Battersea, etc., which
never could have been islands. Perhaps [Old English: þeordig] (_worthy_,
_worth_) was similar, as _werd_, _werth_, in German is an island.

[436] Mr. Croker says this is _moruach_, sea-maid; the only word we find
in O'Reilly is [Irish Uncial: muirimmgeac] (_múrirgach_). We have met no
term answering to _merman_.

[437] It is a rule of the Irish language, that the initial consonant of
an oblique case, or of a word _in regimine_, becomes aspirated; thus
_Pooka_ (nom.), _na Phooka_ (gen.), _mac_ son, _a mhic_ (_vic_) my son.

[438] In Irish [Irish Uncial: lobaircin] (_lubárkin_); the Ulster name
is Logheryman, in Irish [Irish Uncial: locarman] (_lucharman_). For the
Cork term Cluricaun, the Kerry Luricaun and the Tipperary Lurigadaun, we
have found no equivalents in the Irish dictionaries. The short _o_ in
Irish, we may observe, is pronounced as in French and Spanish, _i. e._
as _u_ in _but_, _cut_; _ai_ nearly as _a_ in _fall_. It may be added,
on account of the following tales, that in Kildare and the adjoining
counties the short English _u_, in _but_, _cut_, etc., is invariably
pronounced as in _pull_, _full_, while this _u_, is pronounced as that
in _but_, _cut_.

[439] The Ulster _Lucharman_ also has such an English look, that we
should be tempted to derive it from the Ang.-Sax. _lácan_, _læcan_, to
play. Loki _Löjemand_, or Loki Playman, is a name of the Eddaic deity
Loki in the Danish ballads.

[440] In the place of the Witch of Edmonton usually quoted with this,
_Lubrick_ is plainly the Latin _lubricus_.

[441] It will be observed that these, as well as the Young Piper in
the Appendix, are related in the character of a peasant. This was in
accordance with a frame that was proposed for the Fairy Legends, but
which proved too difficult of execution to be adopted.

[442] Lit. Yellow-stick, the ragwort or ragweed, which grows to a
great size in Ireland.

[443] A kind of spade with but one step, used in Leinster.

[444] All that is said in this legend about the beer is a pure fiction,
for we never heard of a Leprechaun drinking or smoking. It is, however,
a tradition of the peasantry, that the Danes used to make beer of the
heath. It was a Protestant farmer in the county of Cavan, that showed
such knowledge of the siege of Derry; the Catholic gardener who told us
this story, knew far better. It is also the popular belief that the
Danes keep up their claim on Ireland, and that a Danish father, when
marrying his daughter, gives her a portion in Ireland.

[445] _i. e._ Felix. On account of the Romish custom of naming after
Saints, Felix, Thaddæus, Terence, Augustine, etc., are common names
among the peasantry.

[446] In our Tales and Popular Fictions, p. 16, we noticed the
coincidence between this and a passage in an Arabic author. We did not
then recollect the following verses of Milton,

      The willows and the hazle copses green
      Shall now no more be seen
      Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays.
                                            _Lycidas_, 42.

The simile of the moon among the stars in the same place, we have since
found in the Nibelungen Lied (st. 285), and in some of our old poets,
and Hammer says (Sehirin i. note 7), that it occurs even to satiety in
Oriental poetry. In like manner Camoens' simile of the mirror, mentioned
in the same place, occurs in Poliziano's Stanze i. 64.
