The Morlacchi of Dalmatia, as Sir Gardner Wilkinson informs us,[584]
believe also in the Vila. They describe her as a handsome female, who
accompanies the man who is her favourite everywhere he goes, and
causes all his undertakings to prosper. One thus favoured is termed
Vilénik. Another of their objects of belief is the Maçieh, who appears
in the form of a boy, with a cap on his head, and is always laughing.
Any one to whom he appears gets the power of commanding him. If
ordered to bring money, he usually steals it from one of the
neighbours, and if taxed with his dishonesty, he goes to the sea and
comes back dripping and with money.
