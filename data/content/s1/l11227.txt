                              GERTRUDE.

        Odds me! how wise the child is! what a loss
      And pity 'tis that in old times the folk
      Were not so thoughtful and so over-knowing!
      Ah! our poor simple fathers should rise up
      Out of their graves, and come to get advice
      And comfort from the brooders that are now,--
      As if they knew not what was right and fit!
        Have but a little patience, girl, and spin
      What's on your rock; to-morrow when 'tis day
      I'll let you see the Dwarfs' flowered table-cloth,
      Which, in the chest laid safe, inherited
      From mother down to daughter, I have long
      Kept treasured under lock and key, for fear
      Some little girl, like some one that you know,
      Might out of curiosity, and not
      Acquainted with its worth, set it astray.
