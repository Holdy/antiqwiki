                          _Proud Margaret._

      Proud Margaret's[165] father of wealth had store,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      And he was a king seven kingdoms o'er,
        But that grief is heavy I know.[166]

      To her came wooing good earls two,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      But neither of them would she hearken unto,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      To her came wooing princes five,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      Yet not one of them would the maiden have,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      To her came wooing kings then seven,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      But unto none her hand has she given,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      And the hill-king asked his mother to read,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      How to win proud Margaret he might speed,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      "And say how much thou wilt give unto me,"
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "That herself may into the hill come to thee?"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      "Thee will I give the ruddiest gold,"
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "And thy chests full of money as they can hold,"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      One Sunday morning it fell out so,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      Proud Margaret unto the church should go,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      And all as she goes, and all as she stays,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      All the nearer she comes where the high hill lay,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      So she goeth around the hill compassing,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      So there openeth a door, and thereat goes she in,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      Proud Margaret stept in at the door of the hill,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      And the hill-king salutes her with eyes joyfúl,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      So he took the maiden upon his knee,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      And took the gold rings and therewith her wed he,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      So he took the maiden his arms between,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      He gave her a gold crown and the name of queen,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      So she was in the hill for eight round years,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      There bare she two sons and a daughter so fair,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      When she had been full eight years there,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      She wished to go home to her mother so dear,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      And the hill-king spake to his footpages twain,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "Put ye the gray paeers now unto the wain,"[167]
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      And Margaret out at the hill-door stept,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      And her little children they thereat wept,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      And the hill-king her in his arms has ta'en.
        Time with me goes slow.--
      So he lifteth her into the gilded wain,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      "And hear now thou footpage what I unto thee say,"
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "Thou now shalt drive her to her mother's straightway,"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      Proud Margaret stept in o'er the door-sill,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      And her mother saluteth her with eyes joyfúl,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      "And where hast thou so long stayed?"
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "I have been in the flowery meads,"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      "What veil is that thou wearest on thy hair?"
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "Such as women and mothers use to wear,"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      "Well may I wear a veil on my head,"
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "Me hath the hill-king both wooed and wed,"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      "In the hill have I been these eight round years,"
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "There have I two sons and a daughter so fair,"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      "There have I two sons and a daughter so fair,"
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "The loveliest maiden the world doth bear,"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      "And hear thou, proud Margaret, what I say unto thee,"
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "Can I go with thee home thy children to see?"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      And the hill-king stept now in at the door,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      And Margaret thereat fell down on the floor,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      "And stayest thou now here complaining of me,"
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "Camest thou not of thyself into the hill to me?"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      "And stayest thou now here and thy fate dost deplore?"
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "Camest thou not of thyself in at my door?"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      The hill-king struck her on the cheek rosie,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "And pack to the hill to thy children wee,"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      The hill-king struck her with a twisted root,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "And pack to the hill without any dispute,"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      And the hill-king her in his arms has ta'en,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      And lifted her into the gilded wain,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      "And hear thou my footpage what I unto thee say,"
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "Thou now shalt drive her to my dwelling straightway,"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      Proud Margaret stept in at the hill door,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      And her little children rejoiced therefòre,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      "It is not worth while rejoicing for me,"
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "Christ grant that I never a mother had been,"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      The one brought out a gilded chair,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      "O rest you, my sorrow-bound mother, there,"
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      The one brought out a filled up horn,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      The other put therein a gilded corn,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      The first drink she drank out of the horn,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      She forgot straightway both heaven and earth,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      The second drink she drank out of the horn,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      She forgot straightway both God and his word,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      The third drink she drank out of the horn,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      She forgot straightway both sister and brother,
        But that grief is heavy I know.

      She forgot straightway both sister and brother,
        Time with me goes slow.--
      But she never forgot her sorrow-bound mother,
        But that grief is heavy I know.[168]
