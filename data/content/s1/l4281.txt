FOOTNOTES:

[128] That is, Wise People or Conjurors. They answer to the
Fairy-women of Ireland.

[129] Afzelius is of opinion that this notion respecting the
Hill-people is derived from the time of the introduction of
Christianity into the north, and expresses the sympathy of the first
converts with their forefathers, who had died without a knowledge of
the Redeemer, and lay buried in heathen earth, and whose unhappy
spirits were doomed to wander about these lower regions, or sigh
within their mounds till the great day of redemption.

[130] "About fifteen years ago," says Ödman (Bahuslän, p. 80), "people
used to hear, out of the hill under Gärun, in the parish of Tanum, the
playing, as it were, of the very best musicians. Any one there who had
a fiddle, and wished to play, was taught in an instant, provided they
promised them salvation; but whoever did not do so, might hear them
within, in the hill, breaking their violins to pieces, and weeping
bitterly." See Grimm. Deut. Myth. 461.

[132] Svenska Folk-Visor, vol. iii. p. 159. There is a similar legend
in Germany. A servant, one time, seeing one of the little ones very
hard-set to carry a single grain of wheat, burst out laughing at him.
In a rage, he threw it on the ground, and it proved to be the purest
gold. But he and his comrades quitted the house, and it speedily went
to decay.--Strack. Beschr. v. Eilsen, p. 124, _ap._ Grimm, Introd.,
etc., p. 90.

[133] Thiele, vol. iv. p. 22. They are called Trolls in the original.
As they had a king, we think they must have been Elves. The Dwarfs
have long since abolished monarchy.

[134] The greater part of what precedes has been taken from Afzelius
in the Svenska Visor, vol. iii.

[135] Thiele, iv. 26.

[136] In the distinction which we have made between the Elves and
Dwarfs we find that we are justified by the popular creed of the
Norwegians.--Faye, p. 49, _ap._ Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie, p. 412.

[137] Svenska Visor, iii. 158, as sung in Upland and East Gothland.

[138] Svenska Visor, iii. 165, from a MS. in the Royal Library. This and
the preceding one are variations of the Danish Ballad of Elveskud, which
has been translated by Dr. Jamieson (Popular Ballads, i. 219), and by
Lewis in the Tales of Wonder. The Swedish editors give a third variation
from East Gothland. A comparison of the two ballads with each other, and
with the Danish one, will enable the reader to judge of the
modifications a subject undergoes in different parts of a country.

[139] Svenska Visor, iii. p. 170. This is the Elveshöj of the Danish
ballads, translated by Jamieson (i. 225), and by Lewis. In the different
Swedish variations, they are Hafsfruen, i. e. Mermaids, who attempt to
seduce young men to their love by the offer of costly presents.

A Danish legend (Thiele, i. 22) relates that a poor man, who was working
near Gillesbjerg, a haunted hill, lay down on it to rest himself in the
middle of the day. Suddenly there appeared before him a beautiful
maiden, with a gold cup in her hand. She made signs to him to come near,
but when the man in his fright made the sign of the cross, she was
obliged to turn round and then he saw her back that it was hollow.

[140] Thiele, ii. 67. Framley is in Jutland. Svend (i. e. _Swain_)
Fælling is a celebrated character in Danish tradition; he is regarded as
a second Holger Danske, and he is the hero of two of the Kjempe Viser.
In Sweden he is named Sven Färling or Fotling. Grimm has shown that he
and Sigurd are the same person. Deutsche Mythologie, p. 345. In the
Nibelungen Lied (st. 345) Sifret (Sigurd) gets the strength of twelve
men by wearing the _tarnkappe_ of the dwarf Albrich. Another tradition,
presently to be mentioned, says it was from a Dwarf he got his strength,
for aiding him in battle against another Dwarf. It is added, that when
Svend came home in the evening, after his adventure with the Elle-maids,
the people were drinking their Yule-beer, and they sent him down for a
fresh supply. Svend went without saying anything, and returned with a
barrel in each hand and one under each arm.

[141] Thiele, iii. 43. Odense is in Funen.

[142] Thiele, i. 109. (_communicated_). Such legends, as Mr. Thiele
learned directly from the mouths of the peasantry, he terms _oral_;
those he procured from his friends, _communicated_. Oesterhæsinge, the
scene of this legend, is in the island of Funen.

[143] Thiele, i. 118. (_communicated_). Ebeltoft is a village in North
Jutland.

[144] Thiele, iv. 32. From the circumstances, it would appear that these
were Elves and not Dwarfs; but one cannot be positive in these matters.

[145] Möen and Stevns are in Zealand. As Rügen does not belong to the
Danish monarchy, the former tradition is probably the more correct
one. Yet the latter may be the original one.

[146] Bornholm is a _holm_, or small island, adjacent to Zealand.

[147] The Elle-king of Stevns has his bedchamber in the wall of this
church.

[148] This is evidently the Frau Holle of the Germans.

[149] The preceding particulars are all derived from M. Thiele's work.
