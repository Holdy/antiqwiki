FOOTNOTES:

[469] Poésies de Marie de France, par De Roquefort. Paris, 1820. If any
one should suspect that these are not genuine translations from the
Breton, his doubts will be dispelled by reading the original of the Lai
du Laustic in the Barzan-Breiz (i. 24) presently to be noticed.

[470] See above, p. 21.

[471] The Bas-Breton _Korrigan_ or _Korrigwen_ differs, as we may see,
but little from _Gallican_. Strabo (i. p. 304) says that Demeter and
_Kora_ were worshipped in an island in these parts.

[472] Sena is supposed to be L'Isle des Saints, nearly opposite Brest.

[473] Pomp. Mela, iii. 6.

[474] It might seem hardly necessary to inform the reader that these
verses and those that follow, are our own translations, from Marie de
France. Yet some have taken them for old English verses.

[475]

      E korole nao c'horrigan,
      Bleunvek ho bleo, gwisket gloan,
      Kelc'h ar feunteun, d'al loar-gann.
                 VILLEMARQUÉ, _Barzan-Breiz_, i. 8.

The _c'h_ expresses the guttural.

[476] This manifestly alludes to Lanval or Graelent, or similar stories.

[477] It follows, in M. de Roquefort's edition,

      "Deci ne muez fu ou désis."

Of which we can make no sense, and the French translation gives no
aid. In the Harleian MS. it is

      "De cine muez fu ou de sis,"

which is more intelligible.

[478] This tends to prove that this is a translation from the Breton;
for Innocent III., in whose pontificate the cup was first refused to
the laity, died in 1216, when Henry III., to whom Marie is supposed to
have dedicated her Lais, was a child.

[479] The same was the case with the Wünschelweib (_Wish-woman_) of
German romance.

      Swenne du einêst wünschest nâch mir,
      Sô bin ich endelîchen bî dír,

says the lady to the Staufenberger. She adds,

      Wâr ich wil dâ bin ich,
      Den Wunsch hât mir Got gegeben.

He finds it to be true,

      Er wûnschte nach der frouwen sîn,
      Bî îm sô war diu schöne sîn.
                      GRIMM, _Deut. Mythol._, p. 391.


[480] In the Shâh-nâmeh, Siyawush, when he foresees his own death by
the treachery of Afrasiâb, tells his wife Ferengis, the daughter of
that monarch, that she will bear a son whom she is to name Ky Khosroo,
and who will avenge the death of his father: see Görres, Heldenbuch
von Iran, ii. 32.

[481]

      Desi k'a une hoge vint:
      En cele hoge ot une entree.

M. de Roquefort, in his Glossaire de la Langue Romaine, correctly
renders _hoge_ by _colline_. In his translation of this Lai he renders
it by _cabane_, not, perhaps, understanding how a hill could be
pervious. The story, however, of Prince Ahmed, and the romance of
Orfeo and Heurodis (see above, p. 52), are good authority on this
point: see also above, pp. 405, 408.

[482] In the Harleian MS. Mandement. M. de Roquefort confesses his total
ignorance of this people; we follow his example. May it not, however, be
connected with _manant_, and merely signify people, inhabitants?

[483] Roman de Roux, _v._ ii. 234.

v._ Perron.

[485] Barzan-Breiz, Chants Populaires de la Bretagne, recueilles et
publiés par Th. Hersart de la Villemarqué. Paris, 1846. This is a most
valuable work and deserving to take its place with the Ballads of
Scotland, Scandinavia, and Servia, to none of which is it inferior. To
the credit of France the edition which we use is the fourth. How
different would the fate of such a work be in this country!

[486] We make this distinction, because in the ballads in which the
personage is a Fay, the word used is Korrigan or Korrig, while in that
in which the Dwarfs are actors, the words are Korr and Korred. But the
truth is, they are all but different forms of Korr. They are all the
same, singular and plural. The Breton changes its first consonant like
the Irish: see p. 371. We also meet with Crion, Goric, Couril, as
names of these beings, but they are only forms of those given above.

[487] Hence we may infer that they came originally from Scandinavia,
communicated most probably by the Normans.

[488] Stone-tables. They are called by the same name in Devon and
Cornwall; in Irish their appellation is Cromleach.
