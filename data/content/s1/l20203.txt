                           EASTERN EUROPE.

      Up the hill I went, and gazed round.
       Hoping golden maids to see;
      Trooping lovely maidens came, who
       Round the hill danced merrily.

      All the sweetest ditties singing,
       Sweetest ditties that might be;
      Bearing fragrant apple-blossoms,
       These fair maidens came to me.
