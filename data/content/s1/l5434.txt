                    _The Girl at the Troll-Dance._

A girl, belonging to a village in the isle of Funen, went out, one
evening, into the fields, and as she was passing by a small hill, she
saw that it was raised upon red pillars, and a Troll-banquet going on
beneath it. She was invited in, and such was the gaiety and festivity
that prevailed, that she never perceived the flight of time. At
length, however, she took her departure, after having spent, as she
thought, a few hours among the joyous hill-people. But when she came
to the village she no longer found it the place she had left. All was
changed; and when she entered the house in which she had lived with
her family, she learned that her father and mother had long been dead,
and the house had come into the hands of strangers. She now perceived
that for every hour that she had been among the Trolls, a year had
elapsed in the external world. The effect on her mind was such that
she lost her reason, which she never after recovered.[191]
