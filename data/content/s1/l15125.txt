upon its verge. Often did this malignant genius of the waters allure
women and children to his subaqueous haunts, there to be immediately
devoured. Often did he also swell the torrent or lake beyond its usual
limits, to overwhelm the hapless traveller in the flood."[426]

proceed to another, and, perhaps, an older European family, the Celts.
