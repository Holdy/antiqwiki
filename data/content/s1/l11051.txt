                              GERTRUDE.

      Quick, daughter, quick! spin off what's on your rock.
      'Tis Saturday night, and with the week you know
      Our work must end; we shall the more enjoy
      To-morrow's rest when all's done out of hand.[305]
      Quick, daughter, quick! spin off what's on your rock.
