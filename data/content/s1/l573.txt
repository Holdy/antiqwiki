                      ORIGIN OF THE WORD FAIRY.

Like every other word in extensive use, whose derivation is not
historically certain, the word Fairy has obtained various and opposite
etymons. Meyric Casaubon, and those who like him deduce everything
from a classic source, however unlikely, derive Fairy from [Greek:
Phêr], a Homeric name of the Centaurs;[6] or think that _fée_, whence
Fairy, is the last syllable of _nympha_. Sir W. Ouseley derives it
from the Hebrew [Hebrew: ph'r] (_peër_), _to adorn_; Skinner, from the
Anglo-Saxon [Old English: faran], _to fare_, _to go_; others from
Feres, companions, or think that Fairy-folk is _quasi_ Fair-folk.
Finally, it has been queried if it be not Celtic.[7]

But no theory is so plausible, or is supported by such names, as that
which deduces the English Fairy from the Persian Peri. It is said that
the Paynim foe, whom the warriors of the Cross encountered in
Palestine, spoke only Arabic; the alphabet of which language, it is
well known, possesses no _p_, and therefore organically substitutes an
_f_ in such foreign words as contain the former letter; consequently
Peri became, in the mouth of an Arab, Feri, whence the crusaders and
pilgrims, who carried back to Europe the marvellous tales of Asia,
introduced into the West the Arabo-Persian word _Fairy_. It is further
added, that the Morgain or Morgana, so celebrated in old romance, is
Merjan Peri, equally celebrated all over the East.

All that is wanting to this so very plausible theory is something like
proof, and some slight agreement with the ordinary rules of etymology.
Had Feërie, or Fairy, originally signified the individual in the
French and English, the only languages in which the word occurs, we
might feel disposed to acquiesce in it. But they do not: and even if
they did, how should we deduce from them the Italian Fata, and the
Spanish Fada or Hada, (words which unquestionably stand for the same
imaginary being,) unless on the principle by which Menage must have
deduced Lutin from Lemur--the first letter being the same in both? As
to the fair Merjan Peri (D'Herbelot calls her Merjan Banou[8]), we
fancy a little too much importance has been attached to her. Her name,
as far as we can learn, only occurs in the Cahermân Nâmeh, a Turkish
romance, though perhaps translated from the Persian.

The foregoing etymologies, it is to be observed, are all the
conjectures of English scholars; for the English is the only language
in which the name of the individual, Fairy, has the canine letter to
afford any foundation for them.

Leaving, then, these sports of fancy, we will discuss the true origin
of the words used in the Romanic languages to express the being which
we name Fairy of Romance. These are _Faée_, _Fée_, French; _Fada_,
Provençal (whence _Hada_, Spanish); and _Fata_, Italian.

The root is evidently, we think, the Latin _fatum_. In the fourth
century of our æra we find this word made plural, and even feminine, and
used as the equivalent of Parcæ. On the reverse of a gold medal of the
Emperor Diocletian are three female figures, with the legend _Fatis
victricibus_; a _cippus_, found at Valencia in Spain, has on one of its
sides _Fatis Q. Fabius ex voto_, and on the other, three female
figures, with the attributes of the Moeræ or Parcæ.[9] In this last
place the gender is uncertain, but the figures would lead us to suppose
it feminine. On the other hand, Ausonius[10] has _tres Charites_, _tria
Fata_; and Procopius[11] names a building at the Roman Forum [Greek: ta
tria phata], adding [Greek: outô gar Rhômaioi tas moiras nenomikasi
kalein]. The Fatæ or Fata, then, being persons, and their name
coinciding so exactly with the modern terms, and it being observed that
the Moeræ were, at the birth of Meleager, just as the Fées were at that
of Ogier le Danois, and other heroes of romance and tale, their identity
has been at once asserted, and this is now, we believe, the most
prevalent theory. To this it may be added, that in Gervase of Tilbury,
and other writers of the thirteenth century, the Fada or Fée seems to be
regarded as a being different from human kind.[12]

On the other hand, in a passage presently to be quoted from a
celebrated old romance, we shall meet a definition of the word _Fée_,
which expressly asserts that such a being was nothing more than a
woman skilled in magic; and such, on examination, we shall find to
have been all the Fées of the romances of chivalry and of the popular
tales; in effect, that _fée_ is a participle, and the words _dame_ or
_femme_ is to be understood.

In the middle ages there was in use a Latin verb, _fatare_,[13] derived
from _fatum_ or _fata_, and signifying to enchant. This verb was
adopted by the Italian, Provençal[14] and Spanish languages; in French
it became, according to the analogy of that tongue, _faer_, _féer_. Of
this verb the past participle _faé_, _fé_; hence in the romances we
continually meet with _les chevaliers faés_, _les dames faées_, _Oberon
la faé_, _le cheval étoit faé_, _la clef était fée_, and such like. We
have further, we think, demonstrated[15] that it was the practice of the
Latin language to elide accented syllables, especially in the past
participle of verbs of the first conjugation, and that this practice had
been transmitted to the Italian, whence _fatato-a_ would form _fato-a_,
and _una donna fatata_ might thus become _una fata_. Whether the same
was the case in the Provençal we cannot affirm, as our knowledge of that
dialect is very slight; but, judging from analogy, we would say it was,
for in Spanish _Hadada_ and _Hada_ are synonymous. In the Neapolitan
Pentamerone _Fata_ and _Maga_ are the same, and a Fata sends the heroine
of it to a sister of hers, _pure fatata_.

Ariosto says of Medea--

      E perchè per virtù d' erbe e d'incanti
      Delle Fate una ed immortal fatta era.
                  _I Cinque Canti_, ii. 106.

The same poet, however, elsewhere says--

      Queste che or Fate e dagli antichi foro
      Già dette Ninfe e Dee con più bel nome.--_Ibid._ i. 9.

and,

      Nascemmo ad un punto che d'ogni altro male
      Siamo capaci fuorchè della morte.--_Orl. Fur._ xliii. 48.

which last, however, is not decisive. Bojardo also calls the
water-nymphs Fate; and our old translators of the Classics named them
_fairies_. From all this can only, we apprehend, be collected, that
the ideas of the Italian poets, and others, were somewhat vague on the
subject.

From the verb _faer_, _féer_, to enchant, illude, the French made a
substantive _faerie_, _féerie_,[16] illusion, enchantment, the meaning
of which was afterwards extended, particularly after it had been
adopted into the English language.

We find the word Faerie, in fact, to be employed in four different
senses, which we will now arrange and exemplify.

1. Illusion, enchantment.

      Plusieurs parlent de Guenart,
      Du Loup, de l'Asne, de Renart,
      De _faeries_ et de songes,
      De phantosmes et de mensonges.
                   _Gul. Giar. ap. Ducange._

Where we must observe, as Sir Walter Scott seems not to have been
aware of it, that the four last substantives bear the same relation to
each other as those in the two first verses do.

                             Me bifel a ferly
                             Of _faërie_, me thought.
                                       _Vision of Piers Plowman_, v. 11.

                 Maius that sit with so benigne a chere,
                 Hire to behold it seemed _faërie_.
                                     _Chaucer, Marchante's Tale._

      It (_the horse of brass_) was of _faërie_, as the peple semed,
      Diversè folk diversëly han demed.--_Squier's Tale._

                    The Emperor said on high,
                    Certes it is a _faërie_,
                      Or elles a vanité.--_Emare._

                    With phantasme and _faërie_,
                    Thus she bleredè his eye.--_Libeaus Disconus._

                The God of her has made an end,
                And fro this worldès _faërie_
                Hath taken her into companie.--_Gower, Constance._


Mr. Ritson professes not to understand the meaning of _faerie_ in this
last passage. Mr. Ritson should, as Sir Hugh Evans says, have 'prayed
his pible petter;' where, among other things that might have been of
service to him, he would have learned that 'man walketh in a _vain_
shew,' that 'all is _vanity_,' and that 'the fashion of this world
passeth away;' and then he would have found no difficulty in
comprehending the pious language of 'moral Gower,' in his allusion to
the transitory and deceptive vanities of the world.

2. From the sense of illusion simply, the transition was easy to that
of the land of illusions, the abode of the Faés, who produced them;
and Faerie next came to signify the country of the Fays. Analogy also
was here aiding; for as a Nonnerie was a place inhabited by Nonnes, a
Jewerie a place inhabited by Jews, so a Faerie was naturally a place
inhabited by Fays. Its termination, too, corresponded with a usual one
in the names of countries: Tartarie, for instance, and 'the regne of
Feminie.'

                 Here beside an elfish knight
                 Hath taken my lord in fight,
                 And hath him led with him away
                 Into the _Faërie_, sir, parmafay.--_Sir Guy._

      La puissance qu'il avoit sur toutes _faeries_ du monde.
                                                     _Huon de Bordeaux._

    En effect, s'il me falloit retourner en _faerie_, je ne sçauroye
    ou prendre mon chemin.--_Ogier le Dannoys._

        That Gawain with his oldè curtesie,
        Though he were come agen out of _faërie_.
                                     _Squier's Tale._

        He (Arthur) is a king y-crowned in _Faërie_,
      With sceptre and pall, and with his regalty
      Shallè resort, as lord and sovereigne,
      Out of _Faerie_, and reignè in Bretaine,
      And repair again the ouldè Roundè Table.
                 _Lydgate, Fall of Princes_, bk. viii. c. 24.

3. From the country the appellation passed to the inhabitants in their
collective capacity, and the Faerie now signified the people of
Fairy-land.[17]

         Of the fourth kind of Spritis called the Phairie.
                                   _K. James, Demonologie_, 1. 3.

             Full often time he, Pluto, and his quene
             Proserpina, and alle hir _faërie_,
             Disporten hem, and maken melodie
             About that well.--_Marchante's Tale._

      The feasts that underground the _Faërie_ did him make,
      And there how he enjoyed the Lady of the Lake.
                                   _Drayton, Poly-Olb., Song IV._

4. Lastly, the word came to signify the individual denizen of
Fairy-land, and was equally applied to the full-sized fairy knights
and ladies of romance, and to the pygmy elves that haunt the woods and
dells. At what precise period it got this its last, and subsequently
most usual sense, we are unable to say positively; but it was probably
posterior to Chaucer, in whom it never occurs, and certainly anterior
to Spenser, to whom, however, it seems chiefly indebted for its future
general currency.[18] It was employed during the sixteenth century[19]
for the Fays of romance, and also, especially by translators, for the
Elves, as corresponding to the Latin Nympha.

    They believed that king Arthur was not dead, but carried awaie by
    the _Fairies_ into some pleasant place, where he should remaine
    for a time, and then returne again and reign in as great authority
    as ever.

Thus we have endeavoured to trace out the origin, and mark the progress
of the word Fairy, through its varying significations, and trust that
the subject will now appear placed in a clear and intelligible light.

After the appearance of the Faerie Queene, all distinctions were
confounded, the name and attributes of the real Fays or Fairies of
romance were completely transferred to the little beings who,
according to the popular belief, made 'the green sour ringlets whereof
the ewe not bites.' The change thus operated by the poets established
itself firmly among the people; a strong proof, if this idea be
correct, of the power of the poetry of a nation in altering the
phraseology of even the lowest classes[20] of its society.

Shakspeare must be regarded as a principal agent in this revolution;
yet even he uses Fairy once in the proper sense of Fay; a sense it
seems to have nearly lost, till it was again brought into use by the
translators of the French Contes des Fées in the last century.

      To this great Fairy I'll commend thy acts.
                       _Antony and Cleopatra_, act iv. sc. 8.

And Milton speaks

      Of Faery damsels met in forests wide
      By knights of Logres or of Lyones,
      Lancelot, or Pelleas, or Pellinore.

Yet he elsewhere mentions the

                           Faery elves,
      Whose midnight revels by a forest side
      Or fountain some belated peasant sees.

Finally, Randolph, in his Amyntas, employs it, for perhaps the last
time, in its second sense, Fairy-land:

                                I do think
      There will be of Jocastus' brood in Fairy.
                                           Act i. sc. 3.

We must not here omit to mention that the Germans, along with the
French romances, early adopted the name of the Fées. They called them
Feen and Feinen.[21] In the Tristram of Gottfried von Strazburg we are
told that Duke Gylan had a syren-like little dog,

  Dez wart dem Herzoge gesandt        'Twas sent unto the duke, pardé,
  Uz Avalun, der _Feinen_ land,       From Avalun, the Fays' countrie,
      Von einer Gottinne.--V. 1673.       By a gentle goddess.

In the old German romance of Isotte and Blanscheflur, the hunter who
sees Isotte asleep says, I doubt

  Dez sie menschlich sei,                   If she human be,
  Sie ist schöner denn eine _Feine_,        She is fairer than a Fay.
  Von Fleische noch von Beine               Of flesh or bone, I say,
  Kunte nit gewerden                        Never could have birth
  So schönes auf der erden.                 A thing so fair on earth.

Our subject naturally divides itself into two principal branches,
corresponding to the different classes of beings to which the name
Fairy has been applied. The first, beings of the human race, but
endowed with powers beyond those usually allotted to men, whom we
shall term FAYS, or FAIRIES OF ROMANCE. The second, those little
beings of the popular creeds, whose descent we propose to trace from
the cunning and ingenious Duergar or dwarfs of northern mythology, and
whom we shall denominate ELVES or POPULAR FAIRIES.

It cannot be expected that our classifications should vie in accuracy
and determinateness with those of natural science. The human
imagination, of which these beings are the offspring, works not, at
least that we can discover, like nature, by fixed and invariable laws;
and it would be hard indeed to exact from the Fairy historian the
rigid distinction of classes and orders which we expect from the
botanist or chemist. The various species so run into and are
confounded with one another; the actions and attributes of one kind
are so frequently ascribed to another, that scarcely have we begun to
erect our system, when we find the foundation crumbling under our
feet. Indeed it could not well be otherwise, when we recollect that
all these beings once formed parts of ancient and exploded systems of
religion, and that it is chiefly in the traditions of the peasantry
that their memorial has been preserved.

We will now proceed to consider the Fairies of romance; and as they
are indebted, though not for their name, yet perhaps for some of their
attributes, to the Peries of Persia, we will commence with that
country. We will thence pursue our course through Arabia, till we
arrive at the middle-age romance of Europe, and the gorgeous realms of
Fairy-land; and thence, casting a glance at the Faerie Queene, advance
to the mountains and forests of the North, there to trace the origin
of the light-hearted, night-tripping elves.
