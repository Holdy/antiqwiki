                      ORIGIN OF THE WORD FAIRY.

Like every other word in extensive use, whose derivation is not
historically certain, the word Fairy has obtained various and opposite
etymons. Meyric Casaubon, and those who like him deduce everything
from a classic source, however unlikely, derive Fairy from [Greek:
Phêr], a Homeric name of the Centaurs;[6] or think that _fée_, whence
Fairy, is the last syllable of _nympha_. Sir W. Ouseley derives it
from the Hebrew [Hebrew: ph'r] (_peër_), _to adorn_; Skinner, from the
Anglo-Saxon [Old English: faran], _to fare_, _to go_; others from
Feres, companions, or think that Fairy-folk is _quasi_ Fair-folk.
Finally, it has been queried if it be not Celtic.[7]

But no theory is so plausible, or is supported by such names, as that
which deduces the English Fairy from the Persian Peri. It is said that
the Paynim foe, whom the warriors of the Cross encountered in
Palestine, spoke only Arabic; the alphabet of which language, it is
well known, possesses no _p_, and therefore organically substitutes an
_f_ in such foreign words as contain the former letter; consequently
Peri became, in the mouth of an Arab, Feri, whence the crusaders and
pilgrims, who carried back to Europe the marvellous tales of Asia,
introduced into the West the Arabo-Persian word _Fairy_. It is further
added, that the Morgain or Morgana, so celebrated in old romance, is
Merjan Peri, equally celebrated all over the East.

All that is wanting to this so very plausible theory is something like
proof, and some slight agreement with the ordinary rules of etymology.
Had Feërie, or Fairy, originally signified the individual in the
French and English, the only languages in which the word occurs, we
might feel disposed to acquiesce in it. But they do not: and even if
they did, how should we deduce from them the Italian Fata, and the
Spanish Fada or Hada, (words which unquestionably stand for the same
imaginary being,) unless on the principle by which Menage must have
deduced Lutin from Lemur--the first letter being the same in both? As
to the fair Merjan Peri (D'Herbelot calls her Merjan Banou[8]), we
fancy a little too much importance has been attached to her. Her name,
as far as we can learn, only occurs in the Cahermân Nâmeh, a Turkish
romance, though perhaps translated from the Persian.

The foregoing etymologies, it is to be observed, are all the
conjectures of English scholars; for the English is the only language
in which the name of the individual, Fairy, has the canine letter to
afford any foundation for them.

Leaving, then, these sports of fancy, we will discuss the true origin
of the words used in the Romanic languages to express the being which
we name Fairy of Romance. These are _Faée_, _Fée_, French; _Fada_,
Provençal (whence _Hada_, Spanish); and _Fata_, Italian.

The root is evidently, we think, the Latin _fatum_. In the fourth
century of our æra we find this word made plural, and even feminine, and
used as the equivalent of Parcæ. On the reverse of a gold medal of the
Emperor Diocletian are three female figures, with the legend _Fatis
victricibus_; a _cippus_, found at Valencia in Spain, has on one of its
sides _Fatis Q. Fabius ex voto_, and on the other, three female
figures, with the attributes of the Moeræ or Parcæ.[9] In this last
place the gender is uncertain, but the figures would lead us to suppose
it feminine. On the other hand, Ausonius[10] has _tres Charites_, _tria
Fata_; and Procopius[11] names a building at the Roman Forum [Greek: ta
tria phata], adding [Greek: outô gar Rhômaioi tas moiras nenomikasi
kalein]. The Fatæ or Fata, then, being persons, and their name
coinciding so exactly with the modern terms, and it being observed that
the Moeræ were, at the birth of Meleager, just as the Fées were at that
of Ogier le Danois, and other heroes of romance and tale, their identity
has been at once asserted, and this is now, we believe, the most
prevalent theory. To this it may be added, that in Gervase of Tilbury,
and other writers of the thirteenth century, the Fada or Fée seems to be
regarded as a being different from human kind.[12]

On the other hand, in a passage presently to be quoted from a
celebrated old romance, we shall meet a definition of the word _Fée_,
which expressly asserts that such a being was nothing more than a
woman skilled in magic; and such, on examination, we shall find to
have been all the Fées of the romances of chivalry and of the popular
tales; in effect, that _fée_ is a participle, and the words _dame_ or
_femme_ is to be understood.

In the middle ages there was in use a Latin verb, _fatare_,[13] derived
from _fatum_ or _fata_, and signifying to enchant. This verb was
adopted by the Italian, Provençal[14] and Spanish languages; in French
it became, according to the analogy of that tongue, _faer_, _féer_. Of
this verb the past participle _faé_, _fé_; hence in the romances we
continually meet with _les chevaliers faés_, _les dames faées_, _Oberon
la faé_, _le cheval étoit faé_, _la clef était fée_, and such like. We
have further, we think, demonstrated[15] that it was the practice of the
Latin language to elide accented syllables, especially in the past
participle of verbs of the first conjugation, and that this practice had
been transmitted to the Italian, whence _fatato-a_ would form _fato-a_,
and _una donna fatata_ might thus become _una fata_. Whether the same
was the case in the Provençal we cannot affirm, as our knowledge of that
dialect is very slight; but, judging from analogy, we would say it was,
for in Spanish _Hadada_ and _Hada_ are synonymous. In the Neapolitan
Pentamerone _Fata_ and _Maga_ are the same, and a Fata sends the heroine
of it to a sister of hers, _pure fatata_.

Ariosto says of Medea--

      E perchè per virtù d' erbe e d'incanti
      Delle Fate una ed immortal fatta era.
                  _I Cinque Canti_, ii. 106.

The same poet, however, elsewhere says--

      Queste che or Fate e dagli antichi foro
      Già dette Ninfe e Dee con più bel nome.--_Ibid._ i. 9.

and,

      Nascemmo ad un punto che d'ogni altro male
      Siamo capaci fuorchè della morte.--_Orl. Fur._ xliii. 48.

which last, however, is not decisive. Bojardo also calls the
water-nymphs Fate; and our old translators of the Classics named them
_fairies_. From all this can only, we apprehend, be collected, that
the ideas of the Italian poets, and others, were somewhat vague on the
subject.

From the verb _faer_, _féer_, to enchant, illude, the French made a
substantive _faerie_, _féerie_,[16] illusion, enchantment, the meaning
of which was afterwards extended, particularly after it had been
adopted into the English language.

We find the word Faerie, in fact, to be employed in four different
senses, which we will now arrange and exemplify.

1. Illusion, enchantment.
