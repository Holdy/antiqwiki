FOOTNOTES:

[457] A lake, on whose banks Taliesin resided.

[458] These Mr. Davies thinks correspond to the Gallicenæ of Mela: see
_Brittany_.

[459] Giraldus Cambrensis, Itinerarium Cambriæ, l. i. c. 8, translated
by Sir R. C. Hoare.

[460] Very likely indeed that Elidurus, or Giraldus either, should
know any thing of Plato or of Marco Polo, especially as the latter was
not yet born!

[461] Book i. chap. 12.

[462] Mythology and Rites of the British Druids.

[463] Abridged from "A Day at the Van Pools;" MS. of Miss Beale, the
author of "Poems" and of "The Vale of the Towey," a most delightful
volume. We have since received from our gifted friend the following
additional information. "Since writing this letter, I have heard a new
version of the last part of the Spirit of the Van. The third offence
is said to be, that she and her husband were _ploughing_; he guiding
the plough, and she driving the horses. The horses went wrong, and the
husband took up something and threw it at them, which struck her. She
seized the plough and went off, followed by the flocks and herds she
had brought with her to Van Pool, where they all vanished, and the
_mark of the ploughshare_ is shown on the mountain at this present
day. She left her children behind her, who became famous as doctors.
Jones was their name, and they lived at a place called Muddfi. In them
was said to have originated the tradition of the seventh son, or
Septimus, being born for the healing art; as for many generations,
seven sons were regularly born in each family, the seventh of whom
became the doctor, and wonderful in his profession. It is said even
now, that the Jones of Muddfi are, or were, until very recently,
clever doctors."--A. B. A somewhat different version of this legend is
given by Mr. Croker, iii. 256.

[464] For the chief part of our knowledge respecting the fairy lore of
Wales we are indebted to the third or supplemental volume of the Fairy
Legends, in which Mr. Croker, with the aid of Dr. Owen Pugh and other
Welsh scholars, has given a fuller account of the superstitions of the
people of the Principality, than is, we believe, to be found any where
else.

[465] A Relation of Apparitions of Spirits in the County of Monmouth and
the Principality of Wales, by the Rev. Edward Jones of the Tiarch.--For
our extracts from this work we are indebted to Mr. Croker.

[466] The lady's name was Williams. The legends were originally intended
for the present work, but circumstances caused them to appear in the
supplemental volume of the Irish Fairy Legends. We have abridged them.

[467] Gitto is the dim. of Griffith: _bach_ (_beg_ Ir.) is little.
