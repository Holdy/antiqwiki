                           _The Portunes._

In another part of this work the Chancellor says,[323]--

"They have in England certain demons, though I know not whether I
should call them demons or figures of a secret and unknown generation,
which the French call Neptunes, the English Portunes.[324] It is their
nature to embrace the simple life of comfortable farmers, and when, on
account of their domestic work, they are sitting up at night, when
the doors are shut, they warm themselves at the fire, and take little
frogs out of their bosom, roast them on the coals, and eat them. They
have the countenance of old men, with wrinkled cheeks, and they are of
a very small stature, not being quite half-an-inch high.[325] They
wear little patched coats, and if anything is to be carried into the
house, or any laborious work to be done, they lend a hand, and finish
it sooner than any man could. It is their nature to have the power to
serve, but not to injure. They have, however, one little mode of
annoying. When in the uncertain shades of night the English are riding
any where alone, the Portune sometimes invisibly joins the horseman;
and when he has accompanied him a good while, he at last takes the
reins, and leads the horse into a neighbouring slough; and when he is
fixed and floundering in it, the Portune goes off with a loud laugh,
and by sport of this sort he mocks the simplicity of mankind.
