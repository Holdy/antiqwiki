FOOTNOTES:

[42] Compare Antar and the Suspended Poems (translated by Sir W.
Jones) with the later Arabic works. Antar, though written by Asmai the
court-poet of Haroon-er-Rasheed, gives the manners and ideas of the
Arabs of the Desert.

[43] The Jinn are mentioned in the Kur창n and also in Antar.

[44] See Tales and Popular Fictions, p. 37, _seq._ Lane, Thousand and
One Nights, _passim_.

[45] Genius and Jinn, like Fairy and Peri, is a curious coincidence.
The Arabian Jinnee bears no resemblance whatever to the Roman Genius.

[46] "When we said unto the Angels, Worship ye Adam, and they
worshiped except Iblees (who) was of the Jinn."--Kur창n. chap. xviii.
v. 48. Worship is here prostration. The reply of Iblees was, "Thou
hast created _me_ of fire, and hast created _him_ of earth."--_Ib._
vii. 11; xxxviii. 77.

[47] It was the belief of the Irish peasantry, that whirlwinds of dust
on the roads were raised by the Fairies, who were then on a journey. On
such occasions, unlike the Arabs, they used to raise their hats and say,
"God speed you, gentlemen!" For the power of iron, see _Scandinavia_.

[48] The Arabs when they pour water on the ground, let down a bucket
into a well, enter a bath, etc., say, "Permission!" (_Destoor!_) or,
Permission, ye blessed! (_Destoor, y창 mub창rakeen!_)

[49] For the preceding account of the Jinn, we are wholly indebted to
Lane's valuable translation of the Thousand and One Nights, i. 30,
_seq._

[50] The first is given by Lane, the other two by D'Herbelot.
