                          _The Hill-Smith._

Biörn Martinsson went out shooting, one day, with a gamekeeper, on the
wooded hill of Ormkulla. They there found a hill-smith (_bergsmed_)
lying fast asleep. Biörn directed the gamekeeper to secure him, but he
refused, saying "Pray to God to protect you! The hill-smith will fling
you down to the bottom of the hill." He was, however, bold and
determined, and he went up and seized the sleeping hill-smith, who
gave a cry, and implored him to let him go, as he had a wife and seven
little children. He said he would also do any iron work that should be
required; it would only be necessary to leave iron and steel on the
side of the hill, and the work would be found lying finished in the
same place. Biörn asked him for whom he worked; he replied, "For my
companions." When Biörn would not let him go, he said, "If I had my
mist-cap (_uddehat_) you should not carry me away. But if you do not
let me go, not one of your posterity will attain to the importance
which you possess, but continually decline;" which certainly came to
pass. Biörn would not, however, let him go, but brought him captive to
Bahus. On the third day, however, he effected his escape out of the
place in which he was confined.[189]
