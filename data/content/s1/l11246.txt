        Ah, that is kind, dear mother; and see now
      How broad awake I am, and how so smart
      I'm finishing my work since you relate
      These pretty tales; but I will call you up
      Out of your bed to-morrow in the morning
      So early! Oh, I wish now it were day
      Already, for I'm sure I shall not get
      One wink of sleep for thinking of the cloth.[307]
