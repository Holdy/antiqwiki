                   _The Peasant and the Waterman._

A Water-man once lived on good terms with a peasant who dwelt not far
from his lake. He often visited him, and at last begged that the peasant
would visit him in his house under the water. The peasant consented, and
went down with him. There was everything down under the water as in a
stately palace on the land,--halls, chambers, and cabinets, with costly
furniture of every description. The Water-man led his guest over the
whole, and showed him everything that was in it. They came at length to
a little chamber, where were standing several new pots turned upside
down. The peasant asked what was in them. "They contain," was the reply,
"the souls of drowned people, which I put under the pots and keep them
close, so that they cannot get away." The peasant made no remark, and he
came up again on the land. But for a long time the affair of the souls
continued to give him great trouble, and he watched to find when the
Water-man should be from home. When this occurred, as he had marked the
right way down, he descended into the water-house, and, having made out
the little chamber, he turned up all the pots one after another, and
immediately the souls of the drowned people ascended out of the water,
and recovered their liberty.[294]
