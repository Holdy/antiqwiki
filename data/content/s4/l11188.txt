MEMORIALS OF OLD HERTFORDSHIRE.

 Edited by PERCY CROSS STANDING. Dedicated by kind permission to the
 Right Hon. the Earl of Clarendon, G.C.B., Lord Chamberlain.

 “... The book, which contains some magnificent illustrations, will
 be warmly welcomed by all lovers of our county and its entertaining
 history.”—_West Herts and Watford Observer._

 “... The volume as a whole is an admirable and informing one, and all
 Hertfordshire folk should possess it, if only as a partial antidote
 to the suburbanism which threatens to overwhelm their beautiful
 county.”—_Guardian._
