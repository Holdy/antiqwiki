MEMORIALS OF OLD OXFORDSHIRE.

 Edited by the Rev. P. H. DITCHFIELD, M.A., F.S.A. Dedicated by kind
 permission to the Right Hon. the Earl of Jersey, G.C.B., G.C.M.G.

 “This beautiful book contains an exhaustive history of ‘the wondrous
 Oxford,’ to which so many distinguished scholars and politicians look
 back with affection. We must refer the reader to the volume itself ...
 and only wish that we had space to quote extracts from its interesting
 pages.”—_Spectator._
