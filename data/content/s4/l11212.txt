MEMORIALS OF OLD SOMERSET.

 Edited by F. J. SNELL, M.A. Dedicated by kind permission to the Most
 Hon. the Marquis of Bath.

 “In these pages, as in a mirror, the whole life of the county,
 legendary, romantic, historical, comes into view, for in truth the
 book is written with a happy union of knowledge and enthusiasm—a fine
 bit of glowing mosaic put together by fifteen writers into a realistic
 picture of the county.”—_Standard._
