[Illustration:
 Ringstead and Holworth.

 “Where one may walk along the undulating downs that skirt the Channel,
 held in place by parapets of cliff that break down straight into the
 sea; where one may walk mile after mile on natural lawn and not meet a
 soul—just one’s self, the birds, the glorious scenery, and God.”
 (_See page 109._)
_From a water-colour sketch by Mr. William Pye._]
