 “A very delightful addition to a delightful series. Kent, rich in
 honour and tradition as in beauty, is a fruitful subject of which
 the various contributors have taken full advantage, archæology,
 topography, and gossip being pleasantly combined to produce a volume
 both attractive and valuable.”—_Standard._
