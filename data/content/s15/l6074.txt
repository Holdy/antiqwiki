  Glossary and Notes.

In this, the "Falstaff" Edition of Shakespeare's Works, the order in
which the plays are presented is that of the first folio edition of
1623--"Pericles," which was not included in that edition, and the
poems being added at the end of the volume. No new reading of the
text is attempted; and only those variations from the text of the
early editions are included which have been accepted by the best
Shakespearean critics. The task of the present Editor has consisted
solely in the choice between the readings of these critics, where they
disagree. For the most part the text of Delius has been followed.
