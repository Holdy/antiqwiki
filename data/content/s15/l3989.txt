"_Phoebe Steward_, of Syderstone, in the county of Norfolk, widow,
now voluntarily declareth, and is prepared at any time to confirm
the same on oath, and say: That about twenty years ago, a few days
after Michaelmas, she was left in charge of Syderstone Parsonage,
then occupied by Mr. Henry Crafer; and about eight o'clock in the
evening, while sitting in the kitchen, after securing all the doors,
and no other person being in the house, she heard great noises in
the sleeping rooms over her head, as of persons 'running out of one
room into another'--'stumping about very loud'--and that these noises
continued about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour:--that she felt
the more alarmed, being satisfied there was, at that time, no one but
herself in the house.--And the said Phoebe Steward further states,
that on Whitsun-Tuesday, eighteen years ago, she was called to attend,
as nurse, on Mrs. Elizabeth Parsons, in one of her confinements, then
living in Syderstone Parsonage:--That about a fortnight after that
time, one night, about twelve o'clock, having just got her patient to
bed, she remembers to have plainly heard the footsteps, as of someone
walking from their sleeping-room door, down the stairs, step by step,
to the door of the sitting-room below:--that she distinctly heard the
sitting-room door open, and the chair placed near one of the windows
moved; and the shutters opened. All this the said Phoebe Steward is
quite sure she distinctly heard, and thereupon immediately, on being
desired, she came downstairs, in company with another female, whom she
had awakened to go with her, being too much alarmed to go by herself:
but on entering the room she found everything just as she had left
it.--And the said Phoebe Steward further states, that about a fortnight
after the last-named event, while sleeping on a bureau bedstead in
one of the lower rooms in Syderstone Parsonage,--that is, in the room
referred to in the last statement,--she heard 'a very surprising and
frightful knock, as if it had struck the head of the bed and dashed
it in pieces': that this knock was so violent as to be heard by Mrs.
Crafer in the centre of the house:--that she, the said Phoebe Steward,
and another person who was at that time sleeping with her, were very
much alarmed with this heavy blow, and never knew how to account
for it. And finally, the said Phoebe Steward states, that, during
the forty-five years she has been in the habit of frequenting the
Syderstone Parsonage (without referring to any extraordinary statements
she has heard from her sister, now dead, and others who have resided in
it), that she, from her own positive experience, has no hesitation in
declaring, that in that residence noises do exist which have never been
attempted to be explained.--This Declaration was made and signed this
18th day of June 1833, before me, Derick Hoste, one of His Majesty's
Justices of the Peace for the County of Norfolk.

"The mark (X) of Phoebe Steward."
