"_Elizabeth Goff_, of Docking, in the county of Norfolk, widow, now
voluntarily declareth, and is prepared at any time to confirm the
same on oath, and say: That she entered into the service of the Rev.
William Mantle about the month of April 1785, at which time her said
master removed from Docking to the Parsonage at Syderstone, and the
said Elizabeth Goff further states, that at the time of entering upon
the said parsonage, two of the sleeping rooms therein were nailed up:
and upon one occasion, during the six months of her continuance in the
service of her said master, she well remembers the whole family were
much alarmed in consequence of Mrs. Mantle's sister having either seen
or heard something very unusual, in one of the sleeping rooms over the
kitchen, which had greatly terrified her.--This Declaration was made
and signed this 18th day of June 1833, before me, Derick Hoste, one of
His Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of Norfolk.

"The mark (X) of Elizabeth Goff."
