"_Robert Hunter_, of Syderstone, in the county of Norfolk, shepherd,
now voluntarily declareth, and is prepared at any time to confirm the
same on oath, and say: That for twenty-five years he has lived in the
capacity of shepherd with Mr. Thomas Seppings, and that one night in
the early part of March 1832, between the hours of ten and eleven
o'clock, as he was passing behind the Parsonage at Syderstone in a
pathway across the glebe land near the house, when within about twelve
yards of the back part of the buildings, his attention was arrested
all on a sudden by some very loud 'groanings,' like those 'of a dying
man--solemn and lamentable,' coming as it seemed to him from the centre
of the house above:--that the said Robert Hunter is satisfied these
groans had but then just begun, otherwise he must have heard them long
before he approached so near the house.--He also further states, that
he was much alarmed at these groans, knowing particularly that the
Parsonage at that time was wholly unoccupied, it being about a month
before Mr. Stewart's family came into residence there:--that these
groans made such an impression upon his mind, as he shall never lose,
to his dying hour. And the said Robert Hunter likewise states, that,
after stopping for a season near the house, and satisfying himself
of the reality of these groans, he passed on his way, and continued
to hear them as he walked, for the distance of not less than 100
yards. The said Robert Hunter knows 100 yards is a great way, yet if
he had stopped and listened, he, the said Robert Hunter, doubts not
he could have heard them to a still greater distance than 100 yards:
'so loud and so fearful were they, that never did he hear the like
before.'--This Declaration was made and signed this 19th day of June
1833, before me, Derick Hoste, one of His Majesty's Justices of the
Peace for the County of Norfolk.

"The mark (X) of Robt. Hunter."
