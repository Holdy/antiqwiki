"_Elizabeth_, the wife of George _Parsons_, of Syderstone, in the
county of Norfolk, blacksmith, now voluntarily declareth, and is
prepared at any time to confirm the same on oath, and say: That she
married about nineteen years ago, and then entered upon the occupation
of the south end of the Parsonage at Syderstone, in which house she
continued to reside for the space of nine years and a half. That she,
the said Elizabeth Parsons, having lived at Fakenham previously to
her marriage, was ignorant of the reputed circumstances of noises
being heard in the said house, and continued so for about nine or ten
months after entering upon it; but that, at the end of that time, upon
one occasion during the night, she remembers to have been awoke by
some 'very violent and very rapid knocks' in the lower room occupied
by them, immediately under the chamber in which she was sleeping;
that the noise appeared to her to be as against the stove which she
supposed must have been broken to pieces; That she, the said Elizabeth
Parsons, awoke her husband, who instantly heard the same noise; that he
immediately arose, struck a light, and went downstairs; but that, upon
entering the room, he found everything perfectly safe, as they had been
left upon their going to bed; that her husband hereupon returned to the
sleeping room, put out the light, and went to bed; but scarcely had he
settled himself in bed, before the same heavy blows returned; and were
heard by both of them for a considerable time.--This being the first of
the noises she, the said Elizabeth Parsons, ever heard, she was greatly
alarmed, and requested her husband not to go to sleep while they
lasted, lest she should die from fear; but as to the causes of these
noises, she, the said Elizabeth Parsons, cannot, in anywise, account.
And the said Elizabeth Parsons further states, that about a year
afterwards at midnight, during one of her confinements, her attention
was particularly called to some strange noises heard from the lower
room. These noises were very violent, and, as much as she remembers,
were like the opening and tossing up and down of the sashes, the
bursting of the shutters, and the crashing of the chairs placed at the
windows: that her nurse hereupon went downstairs to examine the state
of the room, but, to the surprise of all, found everything perfectly
in order, as she had left it.--And likewise the said Elizabeth Parsons
further states, that besides the occurrences hereinbefore particularly
stated and which remain quite fresh in her recollection, she was, from
time to time, during her residence in Syderstone Parsonage, constantly
interrupted by very frightful and unusual knockings, various and
irregular;--sometimes they were heard in one part of the house, and
sometimes in another;--sometimes they were frequent, and sometimes two
or three weeks or months or even twelve months would pass, without any
knock being heard. That these knocks were usually never given till the
family were all at rest at night, and she has frequently remarked, just
at the time she hoped she had got rid of them, they returned to the
house, with increased violence.--And finally the said Elizabeth Parsons
declares, that during a residence in the Syderstone Parsonage of
upwards of nine years, knocks and noises were heard by her therein, for
which she was utterly unable to assign any cause.--This Declaration was
made and signed this 18th day of June 1833, before me, Derick Hoste,
one of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of Norfolk.

  "ELIZABETH PARSONS."
