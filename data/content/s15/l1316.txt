When Morgan returned some half an hour later, accompanied by the
lodge-keeper and one of the under-gardeners, they found Sir George
lying in a heap on the floor--unconscious. He did not die, however,
neither did he go mad; but his heart was badly affected, and he
subsequently developed fits.

Nothing would induce him to describe what had actually taken place,
and this, added to the fact that he never again set foot within "The
Mayfields," caused his friends to draw their own conclusions. Morgan
told me all about it, and I at once wrote to Dr. Sickertorft. I was too
late, however; Dr. Sickertorft had been dead some weeks--he had died
of cerebral tuberculosis exactly three months after Morgan's visit to
"The Mayfields." I was informed that he attributed the fatal malady to
supernormal concentration.
