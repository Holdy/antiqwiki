"SYDERSTONE PARSONAGE

"For the information of the public, as well as for the protection
of the family now occupying the above residence from the most
ungenerous aspersions, the subjoined documents have been prepared.
These documents, it was proposed, should appear before the public as
Affidavits, but a question of law having arisen as to the authority
of the Magistrates to receive Affidavits on subjects of this nature,
the Declarations hereunder furnished have been adopted in their stead.
The witnesses whose testimony is afforded have been all separately
examined--their statements, in every instance, have been most
cheerfully afforded--and the solemn impression under which the evidence
of some of them particularly has been recorded, has served to show how
deeply the events in question have been fixed in their recollection.
Without entering upon the question of Causes, one Fact, it is presumed,
must be obvious to all (namely): That various inexplicable noises
have been heard in the above residence, at different intervals, and
in different degrees of violence, for many years before the present
occupiers ever entered upon it: indeed, the Testimony of other
respectable persons to this Fact might have been easily adduced, but
it is not likely that any who are disposed to reject or question the
subjoined evidence would be influenced by any additional Testimony
which could be presented:--
