The next day I took the chair back to its owner. I had had enough of
it--quite enough; and I told him my experiences.

"Odd!" he said, "very odd. The impressions you received when sitting in
the chair are almost identical with those of the other people who have
sat in it. I wonder if a murder did actually take place in that house?
I shouldn't be at all surprised. There is an old stain on the floor of
one of the rooms on the second landing, and they say that, despite the
most vigorous washing, it still retains its colour--red, blood-red."
