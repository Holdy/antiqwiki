"_Elizabeth_, the wife of John _Hooks_, of Syderstone, in the county
of Norfolk, labourer, now voluntarily declareth, and is prepared at
any time to confirm the same on oath, and say: That she entered the
service of the Rev. Thomas Skrimshire, at Syderstone Parsonage, about
seven years ago, and continued with him about four years; that in the
last year of her service with Mr. Skrimshire, about Christmas-time,
while sitting by the kitchen fireside, she heard a noise resembling
the moving and rattling of the chairs about the sleeping rooms
immediately over her;--that the noise was so great that one of Mr.
Skrimshire's daughters came out of the drawing-room (which was removed
a considerable distance from the spot in which the noise was heard)
to make inquiry about it: that the manservant and part of the family
immediately went upstairs, but found nothing displaced;--and moreover
that she verily believes no member of the family was upstairs at
the time.--The said Elizabeth Hooks also states, that, upon another
occasion, after the above event, as she was going up the attic stairs
to bed, with her fellow-servant, about eleven o'clock at night, she
heard three very loud and distinct knocks, as coming from the door
of the false roof. These knocks were also heard by the ladies of the
family, then separating for the night, who tried to persuade her it was
someone knocking at the hall door. The said Elizabeth Hooks says, that
although convinced it was from no person out doors, yet she opened the
casement to look and, as she expected, found no one;--indeed (being
closest to the spot on which the blows were struck) she is sure they
were on the door, but how and by whom given she is quite at a loss
to conjecture.--And finally the said Elizabeth Hooks states, that
at another time, after she had got into her sleeping-room (the whole
family besides being in bed, and she herself sitting up working at her
needle) she heard noises in the passage leading to the room, like a
person walking with a peculiar hop: that she was alarmed, and verily
believes it was not occasioned by any member of the family.--This
Declaration was made and signed this 18th day of June 1833, before me,
Derick Hoste, one of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County
of Norfolk.

"The mark (X) of Eliz. Hooks."
