At another time when he was preaching in the town of Alvia among the
hills, the swallows flew about and twittered so loudly that the people
could not hear Saint Francis' voice. The birds did not mean to be rude,
however. So he turned to the swallows and saluted them courteously. "My
sisters," he said, "it is now time that I should speak. Since you have
had your say, listen now in your turn to the word of God and be silent
till the sermon is finished." And again the birds obeyed the smile and
the voice of him who loved them. Though whether they understood the
grown-up sermon that followed, I cannot tell.

But this is the little sermon which he made one day for a congregation
of birds who sat around him in the bushes listening.

"Brother Birds, greatly are ye bound to praise the Creator who clotheth
you with feathers and giveth you wings to fly with and a purer air to
breathe; and who careth for you who have so little care for yourselves."

It was not a long sermon, so the birds could not have grown tired or
sleepy, and I am sure they understood every word. So after he had given
them his blessing he let them go, and they went singing as he had bidden
them.
