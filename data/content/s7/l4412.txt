Transcriber's Notes:

Obvious punctuation errors repaired.

Page 60-61, word split across pages had a dittograph. Extra "pro" was
removed (she heard a prodigious) Original read: (she heard a pro-{page
break}prodigious)

Page 62, a paragraph break was inserted in the text before the line
beginning: "A fox must have stolen it," he said guiltily.
