Francis could not bear to see a little brother in trouble or pain, and
this the beasts knew very well. He would not willingly tread upon an
insect, but would step aside and gently bid the Brother Worm depart in
peace. The fish which a fisherman gave him he restored to the water,
where it played about his boat and would not leave him till he bade it
go.

Once again in the village of Gubbio a live baby hare was brought him as
a present, for his breakfast. But when Francis saw the frightened look
of the little creature held in the arms of one of the brothers, his
heart ached with sympathy.

"Little Brother Leveret, come to me," he said. "Why hast thou let
thyself be taken?" And the little fellow as if understanding the
invitation jumped out of the friar's arms and ran to Francis, hiding in
the folds of his gown. But when Francis took it out and set it free,
very politely giving it permission to depart instead of staying to make
a breakfast, it would not go. Again and again it returned nestling to
its new-found friend, as if guessing that here at least it would be safe
forever. But at last tenderly Saint Francis sent the good brother away
with it into the wood, where it was safe once more among its little
bob-tailed brothers and sisters.
