                                  SAINT GUTHLAC OF CROWLAND



_IN the old legends there may be things which some folk nowadays find it
hard to believe. But surely the theme of each is true. It is not hard to
see how gentle bodies who had no other friends should make comrades of
the little folk in fur and fins and feathers. For, as St. Francis knew
so well, all the creatures are our little brothers, ready to meet
halfway those who will but try to understand. And this is a truth which
every one to-day, even tho' he be no Saint, is waking up to learn. The
happenings are set down quite as they read in the old books. Veritable
histories, like those of St. Francis and St. Cuthbert, ask no addition
of color to make them real. But sometimes, when a mere line of legend
remained to hint of some dear Saint's relation with his friendly Beast,
the story has been filled out in the way that seemed most likely to be
true. For so alone could the old tale be made alive again. So all one's
best is dressing old words new._
