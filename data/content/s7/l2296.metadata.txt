summary: Saint Fronto led seventy monks into the Egyptian desert to serve God in solitude but they faced severe starvation, testing their faith. Just as hope diminished, a caravan of camels loaded with provisions, sent by a rich merchant named Glaucus, arrived miraculously without a guide, restoring the monks' faith and forming an annual tradition of aid.
