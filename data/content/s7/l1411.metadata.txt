summary: Saint Athracta, the daughter of a prince, chose a life of service in a hut by Lough Cara, where she and her maid helped travelers with their horses until the burden of serving a king became too heavy. Showing compassion and creativity, Athracta called upon wild stags to replace their worn-out horses, proving her power and grace, which earned her the autonomy to reign over her peaceful realm without feudal obligations. Saint Kentigern, a gifted student, faced jealousy and trickery from his peers, who plotted to tarnish his reputation by extinguishing a fire under his watch and killing Saint Servanâ€™s pet robin. With divine help, Kentigern miraculously reignites the fire and resurrects the robin, proving his innocence and enhancing his esteemed position within the school.
