summary: Saint Gudwall and his pupil sought refuge in a cave on a small island off the coast of Wales, only to be threatened by a violent winter sea storm that nearly swept them away. In response to Gudwallâ€™s prayers, a shoal of fish built a protective sandbar, allowing them to continue living safely on the island even during the fierce winter months.
